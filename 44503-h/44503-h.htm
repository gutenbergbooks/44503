<h1 class='title pbb'>The Ocean Wireless Boys on the Pacific.</h1>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span><h2 class='nobreak' id='t98'>CHAPTER I.—ON THE BROAD PACIFIC.</h2></div>

<p>Twenty days out from San Francisco in the
vast, heaving desert of the sea, twenty days of
storm, sunshine and calm, the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>, the
great white yacht of Jacob Jukes, head of the big
Atlantic and Pacific Shipping Combine, was making
her way lazily through the dreamy South
Seas. The vessel was capable of great speed,
being known as one of the fastest craft of her
kind. But she was bound on a mission which
might take a long time to consummate, and
economy of coal, which was piled even on her
decks, to re-enforce the supply in the bunkers,
was necessary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>What this mission was remained, so far, a
mystery to every one on board except Mr. Jukes
himself, the iron-jawed and impenetrable organizer
of the expedition. Up to this time he had
shown no inclination to unburden himself of his
secret, and although the craft was equipped with
powerful wireless of the most modern type, the
yacht had received no messages, nor had she
sent any, under orders from Mr. Jukes.</p>

<p>On this particular evening Jack Ready leaned
against the door of the wireless-room, a converted
deck cabin, and covertly watched the
heavy-shouldered, bull-necked form of the millionaire
shipping man as the latter gazed over
the rail across the vacant waters at the gorgeous
sunset.</p>

<p>It was a true pageant of the heavens, such as is
only to be seen in the Southern ocean. Great
cloud-masses rose in wondrous forms, like glorified
castle walls and turrets, glowing with purple
and gold and red. Jack found himself following
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
Mr. Jukes’ gaze. Although such spectacles had
been almost nightly ones since they had steamed
into the tropics, there was something wild and
sinister about the present one that thrilled him.</p>

<p>Captain Septimus Sparhawk, the brown, gaunt
captain of the yacht, whose thin face was decorated
by two little dabs of grayish whiskers forward
of each ear, passed by.</p>

<p>“Nothing to do but to look at the sky, eh?” he
asked Jack, as a suspicion of a smile crept over
his face.</p>

<p>“That’s about all, sir,” rejoined Jack, with a
laugh. “I expect to see spiders spinning webs on
my instruments every day. I haven’t touched
the key since we sailed.”</p>

<p>The captain shook his head. He was an old
and loyal employee of the shipping man, and not
much given to words. But, apparently, now he
felt called upon to express himself.</p>

<p>“It’s a queer business, lad,” he said, “and it
may get queerer still before we find out what it’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
all about. I’m as much in the dark as you or
the cabin boy. But right now that sunset worries
me more than anything else.”</p>

<p>“You’re on the look-out for a storm?” asked
Jack, noting a sudden look of anxiety in the captain’s
pale blue eyes, surrounded by a network
of tiny wrinkles, due to long gazing into salty
gales.</p>

<p>“Worse than that, Ready,” was the rejoinder.
“This is the hurricane season in these parts and
the glass,—I’ve just taken a squint at it,—is
dropping as if it never meant to stop.”</p>

<p>“If I could use the wireless——” began Jack.</p>

<p>“We could probably get a weather reading
from some other ship,” interrupted the captain,
starting off, “but as it is, we might as well not
have it on board at all. The thing’s got me
stumped.”</p>

<p>He carried himself off on his long, thin legs
but paused to speak to Mr. Jukes. The ship-owner,
although Jack could not hear what was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
said, appeared to be agitated somewhat by the
captain’s words, for he began puffing rapidly at
his after-dinner cigar, sending out smoke like
the exhaust of a locomotive funnel, a sure sign,
as Jack had observed, that he was disturbed.</p>

<p>“I’ll make all snug, sir,” the boy heard the
captain say, as he turned away, “and then we will
be prepared for whatever happens.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Sparhawk,” answered Mr. Jukes,
in a somewhat louder voice than he had used
hitherto, “and be sure to see to it that the deck
load of coal is secured safely. They tell me the
bunkers are running low.”</p>

<p>As has been stated, the <em>Sea Gypsy’s</em> decks were
piled high fore and aft with coal, kept in place
by wooden bulkheads, which did not add to the
appearance of the ship and encumbered progress
from bow to stern. Only amidships, where the
cabins were situated, was the deck clear. As the
captain ascended the bridge he turned and gave
an order to a petty officer and presently the crew
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
could be seen at work lashing big tarpaulins down
over the coal which was so important to keep the
<em>Sea Gypsy</em> moving on her mysterious mission.</p>

<p>The news that the coal supply was running
low in the bunkers was a surprise to Jack. He
made for Billy Raynor’s cabin where the young
chief engineer of the yacht was writing up his
“log.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s right,” he rejoined to Jack’s question,
“the loss of that deck load would be a serious
matter. We’re a good many hundred miles from
land and will have to tap the supply before long.”</p>

<p>“Billy, what on earth do you suppose is the
object of this voyage?” demanded Jack abruptly.</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know, but I’m well satisfied with
my promotion and job,” declared Raynor.
“Cruising these wonderful seas in a yacht that’s a
beauty, even if her decks are all littered up like a
cattle boat’s, just about suits me.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, you’ve got something to do,”
complained Jack. “But look at my case. I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
to polish up my instruments every day to keep
them from getting rusty.”</p>

<p>“Serves you right for not stopping ashore and
enjoying yourself,” chuckled Raynor teasingly.
“Since you sold that ‘Universal Detector’ of yours
to the government you could surely afford to.”</p>

<p>“Just as if I could kick my heels on shore doing
nothing,” was Jack’s indignant reply, “but it does
seem as if it’s about time we knew something of
what this voyage is for.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s just a pleasure cruise to allow Mr.
Jukes to get away from his business troubles,”
hazarded Raynor.</p>

<p>Jack shook his head in decided negative.</p>

<p>“There’s more in it than that,” he declared
positively. “Mr. Jukes is first of all a man of
business. He wouldn’t come skylarking across
the Pacific for three weeks if he was just out for
a cruise. He’d go where he could keep in touch
with the market and Wall Street.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Raynor was compelled to agree.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
“Well, I suppose when he gets ready to spill some
information he’ll do it. In the meantime my job
just suits me. But what made you ask about
the deck coal?”</p>

<p>“Because Captain Sparhawk says we’re in for
a bad blow, maybe a hurricane.”</p>

<p>Raynor’s usually cheerful face became suddenly
serious.</p>

<p>“When did he say that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Just now. They’re putting tarpaulins over
it now. If we dropped it, we’d be in a bad fix,
eh, Billy?”</p>

<p>“We’d have about coal enough left for two
or three days,” rejoined Raynor.</p>

<p>“And after that——?”</p>

<p>“It would be a case of ‘merrily we drift
along.’”</p>

<p>The door gave a sudden sharp slam. A puff
of wind, sweeping suddenly over the hitherto
breathless sea, had banged it shut.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>Jack jumped up and swung it quickly open
again.</p>

<p>“Here she comes,” he cried excitedly.</p>

<p>At the same instant the <em>Sea Gypsy</em> gave a sidelong
lurch that sent both lads helter-skelter across
the cabin. Outside came a sudden bawling of
voices and a distant, disquieting roar that grew
louder every second.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span><h2 id='t314'>CHAPTER II.—THE OCEAN IN A RAGE.</h2></div>

<p>Directly they recovered their sea legs, both lads
made for the cabin door. A wonderful but alarming
spectacle met their eyes. The sunset had been
blotted out as if by magic. In its place was a
ragged, inky-black cloud curtain that was being
swept across the sky as if invisible, titanic hands
were swiftly pulling it.</p>

<p>The sea immediately about them was heaving
wildly in great swells that tumbled the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>,
rendered less stable by her top-heavy load, from
side to side. Far off, under the rushing black
cloud, the forefront of which was almost over
them by this time, was a jagged line of white.</p>

<p>Mr. Booth, the second mate, bundled up in oilskins,
ran past the boys on his way to the bridge.</p>

<p>“Better get under cover,” he advised as he
passed. “This is going to be a hummer.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>But, fascinated by the majestic sight, both boys
stood still, clutching the rail and bracing themselves
for the shock they felt was coming, for
both had guessed that the jagged white line in the
distance was a giant wave. Like a cliff of water
it grew as it swept toward them, accompanied
by a howling of the wind that sounded like a
witches’ carnival. So swift was its advance that
the boys had hardly time to run toward the cabin
when it broke upon them.</p>

<p>The <em>Sea Gypsy</em> heeled like a ship that had been
struck a mortal blow. For one instant she hung
balanced as if she was about to capsize. The door
of the cabin in which the boys had taken refuge
was ripped from its hinges by the terrific force
of the impact as if it had been matchwood.</p>

<p>The next moment both lads were struggling
for their lives in a surging, sweeping smother of
water that filled the cabin to the roof. Jack felt
himself clutched by the hands of his chum. Fighting
to keep himself above water, Jack saw that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
Raynor had been hurled against some object and
been wounded. There was a jagged cut in his
forehead.</p>

<p>He had hardly noticed this, when the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>
staggered back to an even keel. As she did so
the water swept out of the cabin like a millrace,
carrying both boys helplessly with it.</p>

<p>Jack felt Raynor torn from his arms, and the
next thing he realized he was struggling for
his life in the waves that reared and roared above
the floundering yacht.</p>

<p>A month before the events we are describing
took place, Jack Ready, the young wireless operator
of the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>, and his inseparable chum,
Billy Raynor, had been summoned to Mr. Jukes’
New York office and told that they were detached
from duty on the big <em>Columbia</em>, the crack liner
of the Jukes’ ships, and ordered to pack their
things forthwith and meet the ship-owner at the
St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco within a week.
Neither had demurred, supposing some interest
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
of the ship-owners called for their presence there.
But, much to their bewilderment, they had each
been handed a substantial check by Mr. Jukes on
his arrival in the western metropolis, told to
outfit themselves for a long voyage, and nothing
more. Two days later the <em>Sea Gypsy</em> cleared the
harbor.</p>

<p>The acquaintance of Jack and Mr. Jukes had
its beginning in certain events which took place
near Jack’s quaint home, which he shared with an
eccentric uncle on an old schooner in the Erie
Basin in New York. The rescue by Jack of Mr.
Jukes’ little daughter, and the result on his affairs,
were fully detailed in the first volume of
this series, which was called “The Ocean Wireless
Boys on the Atlantic.” This is not the place
to re-tell all the exciting adventures that befell
Jack and young Raynor, who was third engineer
on the steamer to which Jack was assigned, in
fulfillment of his ambition to be a “wireless man.”</p>

<p>Nor can we do more here than to hint at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
contents of the second volume. This was called
“The Ocean Wireless Boys and the Lost Liner,”
and set forth the fate of the <em>Tropic Queen</em>. In
this book we found Jack and his inseparable chum
steadily progressing in their chosen professions,
and also met several other characters, all of whom
had an important bearing on the events of the
boys’ lives. Mr. Jukes took formal recognition
of the part Jack played in the disaster that overtook
the <em>Tropic Queen</em>, and inwardly resolved
that his heroism and devotion to duty had made
him a lad worth watching.</p>

<p>Still a third volume followed, describing the
boys’ further adventures. In the “Ocean Wireless
Boys of the Iceberg Patrol,” much interesting
information about the manner in which the
ocean lanes are guarded from the white menace
of the north, was given. The boys shared in
many thrilling adventures also, and ended by discovering
something that an expedition, at the
head of which was Jack’s Uncle Toby, had almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
lost through the tricks of a band of hard characters.</p>

<p>The fourth book setting forth their doings was
called “The Ocean Wireless Boys and the Naval
Code.” Captain Simms of the U. S. N., after
devising a novel code for the use of this government,
through the machinations of a band of
daring rascals, found himself robbed of it. Wireless
played a big part in the recovery of the documents
in the long run, Jack acquitting himself to
the delight of the naval officials and the government
by his work in this connection. Some of
the miscreants, whose tricks Jack had helped to
frustrate, were sent to prison but others got free.
These latter the boys, though they little suspected
it, were destined to meet again.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span><h2 id='t451'>CHAPTER III.—A LONG NIGHT.</h2></div>

<p>Blinded, choked and with a red mist before his
eyes, and in his ears the roar of waters, Jack
fought the undertow of the retreat of the giant
wave with all his strength. All at once he felt
some heavy object hurled against him.</p>

<p>The force of the collision almost knocked what
little breath remained in his body out of his lungs.
Instinctively he reached out for whatever it was
that had struck him.</p>

<p>It was a human body.</p>

<p>The boy had hardly realized this before he
found himself flung, panting and gasping, down
upon the deck. Thanks to the stays of the foremost
of the <em>Sea Gypsy’s</em> two masts, against which
the retreating wave had pitched him, he had
not been drawn overboard. Instead, as the pressure
of water relaxed, it had dropped him and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
the mute burden he had clasped, to the deck.</p>

<p>For a few minutes Jack lay there panting, too
much exhausted to exert a muscle or limb. The
unconscious form hurtled against him by the
swirling waters lay at his side. It was too dark
for Jack to see then who it was, or if life remained
in the motionless figure. By-and-by, as
his strength came back, he got to his feet and
dragged the limp form to a cabin. It proved to
be the one which the great wave had swept from
Jack so unceremoniously. Luckily, although the
seas were thundering mountains high about the
laboring yacht, none like that first terrific comber
assailed her.</p>

<p>Steadying himself on the rocking floor with
much difficulty, Jack fumbled for the electric
switch. He found it at last and let on a flood of
light. The radiance shed itself on a pale face
with a deeply slashed forehead that lay at the
boy’s feet.</p>

<p>“It’s Billy,” choked the boy. He got on his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
knees by Raynor’s unconscious form and gently
raised his chum’s head. It fell back limply. A
blood-chilling thought surged through Jack and
he grew as white as the lad he held.</p>

<p>He put his hand hastily over Raynor’s heart
and a great wave of relief went through him.
His chum’s heart was beating, although feebly.
It was not too late to save him. It was a hard
task for Jack to stagger across that bounding,
reeling floor, carrying the limp and unconscious
Raynor, but at last he managed to accomplish it,
and deposited the injured young engineer in the
bunk that occupied one side of the latter’s cabin.
Then he washed and dressed the injury as best
he could.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll have to get help,” said the boy to
himself. “The captain’s got a medicine chest
and bandages, but we have no doctor. I’ll go and
find the skipper.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'>It was a hard task for Jack to stagger across that bounding, reeling floor, carrying the limp and unconscious Raynor.</p>
</div>

<p>Out upon the dripping decks, over which a
wave crest would every now and then curl, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
a roar like that of a waterfall, Jack once more
emerged. Clawing at hand-holds and desperately
clinging on now and then when a wave threatened
to tear loose his grip, he wormed his way forward.
As he reached the bridge deck, he heard
a thunderous roar forward, and the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>,
as if she had been freed of a burden, made a sudden
plunge skyward, with her bow pointing almost
straight at the obscured heavens.</p>

<p>“There goes the fore-deck load of coal,”
thought Jack, as he made his way to where, in
the lee of the pilot house some obscure figures
stood huddled. Ten minutes later he and the
gaunt form of Captain Sparhawk were bending
over Raynor, as he lay white and still, in his
bunk. With rough skill the captain dressed the
wound.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder that Mr. Jukes wouldn’t have
brought a doctor along,” he muttered. “He’s
carrying a rapid-fire gun, so why not sawbones,
too?”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>“Where is Mr. Jukes?” demanded Jack suddenly.</p>

<p>“In his cabin, I guess. I haven’t seen him since
this ocean tantrum broke out.”</p>

<p>“The—the rapid-fire gun you spoke about?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>The other looked at him in some confusion.</p>

<p>“Confound my habit of talking to myself,” he
exclaimed. “Did you hear that?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it,” apologised Jack. “Are we
going to fight any one?”</p>

<p>“You must ask Mr. Jukes that,” answered the
captain, non-committally. “It’s up to him to tell
what he wants to. All I know is that there is
one on board. Maybe he brought it along to shoot
clay pigeons with. Maybe not. I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he added, “I’ve got to get for’ard
again. I guess our young ship-mate will do now.
He had a nasty crack though. Both of you are
lucky you’re not in Davy Jones’ locker.”</p>

<p>All through the rest of that tempestuous night
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
Jack sat by his chum, dozing off at times and
then waking with a start to hear the uproar of
the hurricane as they struggled through it. The
dawn showed a troubled sea, leaping at the yacht
as though to engulf her. The wind almost flattened
Jack against the deck house as, Raynor
having sunk into a deep sleep after an interval of
consciousness, the young wireless man set out
to see what chance there was for breakfast.</p>

<p>The companionway to the dining saloon on the
deck below was in the after part of the ship. As
he was about to descend an unusually big wave
lifted the <em>Sea Gypsy</em> dizzily skyward, and then
rushed her downward. There was a heave and
a crash from the stern and Jack saw the after
deck load of coal vanish like a black avalanche,
to be swallowed up in the maw of the sea.</p>

<p>“Worse, and more of it,” he muttered, as some
of the crew who had narrowly escaped being
overwhelmed, set up a shout; “this will be bad
news to give poor old Billy.”</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span><h2 id='t606'>CHAPTER IV.—THE DERELICT.</h2></div>

<p>Two days later the hurricane had blown itself
out. The storm-stressed crew were set to work
putting things to rights and the yacht put on more
of her normal appearance. But she had been
sadly battered for all that. Two boats were stove
in, ventilators smashed and stanchions bent and
twisted by the fury of the waves.</p>

<p>The flat, oily sea that succeeded the wild turmoil
of the hurricane, heaved gently without a
ripple as Jack and Raynor, the latter recovered
but still wearing a bandage round his head, stood
looking over the rail into the glassy waters.</p>

<p>So transparent was the ocean that, under them,
they could see great fish swimming about slowly
and lazily, as if life held no hurry for them. Now
and then a great shark glided by, nosing about
the ship for scraps. His sharp, triangular dorsal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
fin stuck from his back like a blue steel knife
cutting the surface and glistening like a thing of
metal. About these great tigers of the deep, two
smaller fish usually hovered. These were pilot
fish, the strange sea-creatures that invariably
accompany sharks, and are supposed by sailors
to pilot them to their prey.</p>

<p>Then there were queer-looking “gonies,” with
their flat heads winging their way above the
water and every now and then dropping, with a
scream and a splash, in a group of a dozen to fight
furiously over some drifting morsel. After these
tussles they appeared to “run” over the water to
give their heavy, awkward bodies a good start
upward. Then, having attained a certain height,
down they would flop again, like weights shooting
through the air, hitting the water with a heavy
splash and sliding, with a white wake behind
them, for some feet.</p>

<p>Schools of nautilus, too, gave them something
to look at as the delicate little creatures, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
their thin, membranous sails set, drifted by under
the gentle breeze that hardly ruffled the water.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look much as if this ocean could ever
have kicked up the ructions it did, eh, Billy?”
remarked Jack, after a long silence.</p>

<p>“It does not,” replied Raynor, with a rueful
grin, “but I owe it this crack on the head.”</p>

<p>“And the loss of that coal,” chimed in Jack.
“No wonder you look glum, old fellow. We’ll
never make port on what’s below.”</p>

<p>“Not a chance of it,” was the rejoinder, “about
all we can do is to use the sails if the worst comes
to the worst.”</p>

<p>“Well, as we don’t appear to have any port
in view, and nothing to do but to keep on drifting
about like another Flying Dutchman, I don’t see
that it much matters where we fetch up,” commented
Jack, with some irritation.</p>

<p>It was at that instant that there came an interruption.
The voice of the sea-man at the
look-out forward broke the spell.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>“Steamer, ho!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Where away?” came a hoarse voice from the
bridge, that of Mr. Jolliffe, the first officer.</p>

<p>“Three p’ints on the starbo’d bow.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go forward and have a look,” suggested
Jack. “You’re not on watch for some time yet.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” agreed Raynor. “Anything
for variety’s sake. Wonder what ship it is?”</p>

<p>“Too far off to make out yet,” said Jack, as,
far off, they could just about see, by straining
their eyes, a small dark speck on the distant horizon.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any smoke,” said Raynor. “Perhaps
it’s a sailing ship after all.”</p>

<p>“We’ll know before long,” was Jack’s reply.</p>

<p>During an interval in which the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>
drew steadily toward the craft that had, by this
time, excited the attention of all on board, the
boys saw Mr. Jukes emerge from his cabin and
take his place on the bridge beside Captain Sparhawk.
That bronzed mariner handed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
millionaire his glasses and Mr. Jukes’ rather fat,
pallid face took on an unwonted hue of excitement
as he handed them back.</p>

<p>The boys standing on the main deck just below
the bridge heard the owner of the yacht putting
sharp questions. He showed more animation
than he had at any time during the voyage. The
sight of the other craft appeared to affect him
curiously.</p>

<p>“She’s a schooner, Sparhawk.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, sir.”</p>

<p>“But although she has her canvas set she is
making no way.”</p>

<p>“That appears to be correct. But there is little
wind. Odd though that she doesn’t signal us.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jukes snatched up the glasses again from
the shelf where he had laid them down.</p>

<p>“Blessed if I can make out a soul on board her,
Sparhawk,” he exclaimed presently. “Here, try
what you can do.”</p>

<p>He handed the binoculars over to the master
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
of the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>. Captain Sparhawk took a prolonged
observation. When he, in turn, laid the
glasses down his thin, mahogany-hued face bore
a puzzled look.</p>

<p>“It’s queer, sir, but I don’t seem to be able to
make out a living soul either.”</p>

<p>“A derelict, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” assented the captain, and no more
was said as, with all eyes fixed on the strange
schooner, the <em>Sea Gypsy</em> drew nearer. The boys
could now make out every detail of the other
craft. She was a trig-looking schooner, painted
black, with a flush deck except for her after house
and a small structure astern of the fore-mast.
Her canvas was set but it flapped idly in the light
breeze as she swung to and fro on the Pacific
swells. No guiding hand could be seen at her
wheel. Not a soul was visible on her deserted
decks.</p>

<p>There is no more melancholy sight than a sea
derelict, the aimless prey of winds and currents,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
drifting sometimes for years over the trackless
wastes of the ocean. The boys felt something of
this as all doubt as to human occupancy of the
schooner vanished.</p>

<p>“Deserted, I reckon,” hazarded Jack. “Although
her canvas appears perfect, her hull sound
and——”</p>

<p>He broke off sharply. From the abandoned
ship there had suddenly come a sound which,
under the circumstances, was particularly depressing
and even startling.</p>

<p>It was the measured tolling of a bell, like a
funeral knell.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span><h2 id='t783'>CHAPTER V.—THE “CENTURION.”</h2></div>

<p>“Hark!” cried Raynor, as the two boys exchanged
glances.</p>

<p>“I have it,” exclaimed Jack the next instant.
“That’s only the tolling of the ship’s bell as the
schooner rolls on the sea.”</p>

<p>“My, it gave me a jump though,” admitted
Raynor. “Hullo, they are slowing down. Must
be going to board her.”</p>

<p>“Evidently,” agreed Jack, as the <em>Sea Gypsy’s</em>
propeller revolved more and more slowly.</p>

<p>Captain Sparhawk descended from the bridge.
The ponderous form of Mr. Jukes followed him.
The millionaire’s face bore a look of strange excitement.</p>

<p>“Of course that can’t be the schooner,” the
boys heard him say to the captain, “but still I
can’t pass it unsearched.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>His eye fell on the boys.</p>

<p>“Lads, we are going to board that schooner and
try to find out something about her,” he said.
“Do you want to go along?”</p>

<p>These were the first words the boys had had
with their employer in some days. Of course
both jumped at the chance, and before many
minutes passed, one of the yacht’s remaining
boats was being sent over the sea at a fast clip
toward the derelict. Close inspection showed the
schooner’s condition not to be as good as it had
seemed at a distance. Her paint was blistered
and the oakum calking was spewing out of her
sun-dried seams like Spanish moss on an aged
tree. Her sails were mildewed and torn in many
places and her ropes bleached and frayed. Mingling
now with the incessant, melancholy tolling
of the bell, came the monotonous creak of her
booms and gaffs as they swung rhythmically to
and fro.</p>

<p>No name appeared on her bow, although
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
blurred tracings of white paint showed that one
had once been inscribed there. But there was a
yellow-painted figurehead; a stern, Roman-nosed
bust of a man, apparently intended for an
emperor or a warrior.</p>

<p>“We’ll row round the stern and take a look
at her name,” decided Captain Sparhawk. “We’ll
have to climb aboard from the other side anyway.
There is no means of scrambling up from this.”</p>

<p>The boat was turned and rowed under the
graceful stern of the derelict. On it, in bold,
raised letters, surrounded by a fanciful design,
stood out, in fading colors, the lost craft’s name.</p>

<p>“<em>Centurion</em>, San Francisco,” read out Jack,
with an odd thrill. There was a sudden exclamation
from Mr. Jukes, who had not yet been able
to make out more than the first few letters.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he exclaimed, in a voice so
sharp and tense that the boys turned and stared
at him, as did the boat’s crew and Captain Sparhawk.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>Jack repeated his answer and, to his astonishment,
Mr. Jukes, the iron-jawed, self-possessed
business man, who had never shown signs of possessing
any more emotion than a stone, suddenly
sunk his head in his hands with a groan.</p>

<p>“Too late after all,” they heard him mutter
unsteadily. But when he again raised his face,
although it was ashy pale, he appeared to have
mastered himself.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve reached the end of our journey,
Sparhawk,” he remarked in a voice that he rendered
steady by an apparent effort. “Let us go
on board, however, and see if we can find some
trace of the unfortunates of the <em>Centurion</em>.”</p>

<p>The captain looked as if he would have liked
to ask a great many questions, but something in
Mr. Jukes’ face rendered him silent. He gave
the necessary orders and the boat was pulled
round to the other side of the schooner. Here
they were glad to find some dilapidated ropes
dangling which afforded a means of getting on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
board. Two sailors, after first testing their
weight-bearing qualities, scrambled up them like
monkeys, and, under the captain’s orders, went
hunting for a Jacob’s ladder which would support
Mr. Jukes’ ponderous weight. One was found
and lowered, and soon all stood on the silent decks
which for so long had not echoed the footsteps
of a human being.</p>

<p>“Away forward and muzzle that bell, some of
you,” ordered the captain briskly. “The sound
of the thing gets on my nerves.”</p>

<p>“Send them all forward,” supplemented Mr.
Jukes. “Tell them to search the forecastle, anything
to keep them busy. We will examine the
cabins and officers’ quarters.”</p>

<p>“Are we to accompany you, sir?” asked Jack
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second the millionaire
seemed plunged in thought. Then he arrived at
one of his characteristic quick decisions.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he asked, half to himself it
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
seemed. “Later I shall have something to say
to all of you. You have wondered at the object
of this cruise, no doubt?”</p>

<p>Captain Sparhawk nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“I have guessed you had some great end to
serve in it, Mr. Jukes,” he said.</p>

<p>“An end which has now been reached, I fear,”
said the millionaire solemnly. “But come, let us
proceed with our examination.”</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span><h2 id='t924'>CHAPTER VI.—A MYSTERY OF THE SEAS.</h2></div>

<p>At first glance Jack saw that the main cabin of
the <em>Centurion</em> was fitted up with a luxuriousness
not common to mere trading schooners. A silver
hanging lamp of elaborate design, silk curtains
at the stern ports, book-cases filled with handsomely
bound volumes and the thick carpets on
the floor, clearly indicated that whoever had occupied
it had been above the class of the rough
and ready South Sea trader.</p>

<p>In one corner stood a desk as handsome in its
appointments as the rest of the furniture. But
it had been roughly dealt with. The front had
been smashed in, drawers pulled out and papers
and documents scattered about all over the cabin
floor. The door to a sleeping cabin leading off
the main apartment was open. Within was the
same disorder. Even mattresses had been ripped
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
open in a hunt for something, the nature of which
the boys could not guess.</p>

<p>Mr. Jukes hastily rummaged through the contents
of the desk, selecting some papers, casting
aside others as worthless, and gathered up on his
hands and knees those on the floor. Then every
cabin was searched and in each the millionaire
took a few papers, but the look of anxiety on his
face did not change, and the boys judged he had
not found what he was in search of.</p>

<p>“Not a solitary clue,” he exclaimed with a
heavy sigh as, dust-covered and perspiring from
his exertions, he sank down at the long dining
table in the main cabin. For a time he appeared
lost in thought and the others stood about silently.
To Jack it was almost awe-inspiring, to see this
over-mastering man of affairs, who bullied whole
corporations into his way of thinking, sitting
there in the cabin of the derelict schooner utterly
at a loss, and apparently defeated. At length Mr.
Jukes spoke. His first words were a surprise:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>“I suppose you all have heard of my brother,
Jerushah Jukes?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The traveler and explorer?” asked Captain
Sparhawk. “I guess every one in America knows
of him, Mr. Jukes.”</p>

<p>Paying no attention to the captain’s reply, the
millionaire went on.</p>

<p>“The papers reported some months ago that
he had set out for Central Africa.”</p>

<p>“I read the account,” said Jack, “but——”</p>

<p>Mr. Jukes waved his hand. The boy fell into
an abashed silence; in a second the millionaire
had changed once more from a crushed, defeated
human being into Jacob Jukes, millionaire and
king of commerce.</p>

<p>“He did not go to Africa,” he said. “Instead,
his destination was the South Pacific. He chartered
this schooner, the <em>Centurion</em>, and the last
I heard of him was when he set sail from San
Francisco. If no news of him was received within
a certain time I promised him to come in search
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
of him. You see,” he added with a simplicity new
from him, “he was my younger brother and I
promised my mother on her death-bed always to
look after him.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. In the silence of the long-deserted
cabin they could hear the dismal creak
of the neglected rudder and the bang-banging of
the swinging spars above.</p>

<p>“We were poor then, miserably poor, and my
mother never lived to see the rise of our fortunes,
for as I advanced in business I helped my
brother up, too. But his bent was not for finance.
He had a streak of the adventurous in him. But
I put it to paying purpose. I seldom lose on any
venture.” Unconsciously as it seemed, the hard
vein in Jacob Jukes had cropped out again. “I
decided to put my brother on a paying basis. The
results were good. Concessions in South
America, gold mines in Alaska, and certain South
African enterprises were put through, largely
through his instrumentality.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>“And now, to get down to the present time.
The <em>Centurion</em> was chartered to obtain for Mrs.
Jukes, who has a craze for expensive and rare
jewelry, the ‘Tear of the Sea,’ the most famous
pearl of the South Seas. I had obtained information
of its whereabouts in the Pomoutou Archipelago
through means which are not important to
relate here. I thought that an expedition to purchase
the ‘Tear of the Sea’ and, incidentally,
other pearls, would be a good investment and
keep my brother, who was getting restless, in
occupation.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, however, a dishonest employee
managed to get wind of what was about
to take place and furnished the information to a
firm of European jewelers with agents in New
York and all over the world. From that moment,
I rushed through the <em>Centurion’s</em> expedition with
all possible speed, for I knew the conditions of
competition in the Pacific. There is little more
law among pearl traders than there is north of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
fifty-three. My brother knew this as well as I
did and realised the necessity for haste. Moreover,
we knew that the European firm was
anxious to obtain, for a royal customer, the very
pearl that I was after. In addition, this firm was
known as one of the most unscrupulous in gaining
its ends, and maintained, in the South Pacific,
a system of spies and bullies which brought
most of the pearl hunters’ prizes into their hands.
Ugly stories have been told of their methods of
gaining their ends—and—and I am afraid the
fate of the <em>Centurion</em> will have to be added to the
black list.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing in the papers to show what
happened to your brother, sir?” asked Captain
Sparhawk presently.</p>

<p>“Nothing. They are merely formal documents,
ship’s papers, clearance bills and so forth. There
is no memorandum relating to the pearl in any
way.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>Captain Sparhawk knitted his brows. For a
minute he appeared lost in deep thought.</p>

<p>“Do you mind telling us the name of that firm,
sir?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>“There is nothing we can prove against them,”
said the millionaire. “They work without their
hands showing in any of their ugly transactions.
Their name, however, is F—— &amp; Freres.”</p>

<p>“Of Amsterdam?” queried the captain.</p>

<p>“The same. They have practically a monopoly
of the pearl trade of Europe.”</p>

<p>“I know that, sir,” said the captain, clenching
his hands. “They tried to work their tricks on
a ship-mate of mine who went a-pearl trading.
But, sir, to change the subject, did you ever hear
of ‘Bully’ Broom?”</p>

<p>The millionaire shook his head.</p>

<p>“I have; and have good cause to remember
him,” said the captain. “But none of that at this
time. Sir,” he continued earnestly, “your brother
may be as safe and sound as we are. He may
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
have the pearl. But if neither of these things
have happened, Bully Broom is the man to look
for if we have to hunt him all over the Pacific.
I’ve sailed these seas and know that ‘Bully’
Broom did F—— &amp; Co.’s dirty work for them.
He calls himself a trader, but, like lots of others
doing business under that name in these waters,
‘Pirate’ would be a sight better name for him.”</p>

<p>“And you think that this man ‘Bully’ Broom,
as you call him, has something to do with this
mysterious disappearance of my brother?” asked
Mr. Jukes, who had listened with deep attention,
willing to hear of any clue, however slight.</p>

<p>“I ain’t dead sure,” said the captain, “but it’s
my impression that if the firm you spoke of was
after this ‘Tear of the Sea,’ then ‘Bully’ Broom
knows where Jerushah Jukes is,” and he brought
his lean, gnarled fist down with a thump on the
table.</p>

<p>The old ginger came back into Mr. Jukes’ eyes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
the wonted crisp authority into his voice as he
snapped out:</p>

<p>“That being the case, we’ll find ‘Bully’ Broom.”</p>

<p>“No matter where we have to go?” asked Captain
Sparhawk, raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“We’ll scour the whole Pacific if necessary.
But nobody of the <em>Sea Gypsy’s</em> crew need accompany
her against his will. All I ask is that they
remain till we can touch at some civilised port,
such as Papeiti or Honolulu and ship a man in
his place. Do you boys wish to stick?”</p>

<p>“To the finish,” came from Jack, and Raynor,
standing beside him, nodded his assent.</p>

<p>As for Captain Sparhawk, he simply reached
out one of his brown hands toward the millionaire,
who clasped it, and said:</p>

<p>“I’m with you till the bottom drops out of the
ship.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Sparhawk. It’s what I expected
of you all,” said Mr. Jukes quietly, but his voice
shook.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>Thus, in the desolated cabin of the derelict
<em>Centurion</em>, there was ratified a bargain that was
to lead the boys into strange seas and stranger
adventures.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span><h2 id='t1158'>CHAPTER VII.—AN OLD ENEMY ODDLY MET.</h2></div>

<p>The lads stood on the stern deck of the <span class='it'>Sea
Gypsy</span>, gazing behind them. On the horizon hovered
a tall, black column of smoke. It marked
the last resting place of the <em>Centurion</em>, for Mr.
Jukes, after ransacking the cabin of everything
associated with his brother, had decided to burn
the derelict, which, if she had drifted into the
paths of navigation, might have proved a dangerous
menace.</p>

<p>“Well, Billy, the mystery is solved at last,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, and in a way I’d never have guessed in
a thousand years. Mr. Jukes must be very fond
of his brother. It’s a new side of his character
to me.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” agreed Jack. “While he has
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
always been just and kind, I thought him a regular
man of business, with ice-water instead of red
blood in his veins, and his heart in his enterprises
only.”</p>

<p>“Just goes to show that you are liable to run
up against a streak of sentiment when you least
expect it,” said Raynor.</p>

<p>“I see now why an embargo was put on the
wireless,” said Jack presently.</p>

<p>“I can’t figure it out. I should have thought
he would have used it to try and locate the <em>Centurion</em>.”</p>

<p>“I guess he figured that if he did so, some ship
might pick up the message and it would reach
the ears of that Amsterdam firm and they would
find out about this expedition in search of Jerushah
Jukes.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that’s it. But there’s one thing sure
and certain, Jack.”</p>

<p>“And that is——?”</p>

<p>“That we can’t do much without coal.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>“Jove, that’s true; I’d forgotten that. What
rotten luck! Where is the nearest coaling place?”</p>

<p>“Papeiti, in Tahiti, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“How close are we to that port now?”</p>

<p>“Well, to-day’s reckoning puts us in Latitude
29 degrees, 49 minutes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to look at the map, but that makes it
quite a run.” The second mate came bustling up
to Raynor.</p>

<p>“The skipper and Mr. Jukes want to see you
in the captain’s cabin,” he said.</p>

<p>“Do you know what about?” asked Raynor.</p>

<p>“Coal, I think. How much have you got to
keep those old tea-kettles of yours chugging?”</p>

<p>“Precious little since your gang on deck let
that deck-load be washed overboard,” grinned
Raynor, as he hurried off.</p>

<p>The consultation lasted a long time. But at
length Raynor returned with the news that, for
as long as possible, full speed was to be made
with the coal in hand, and that then canvas would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
be spread, for the <em>Sea Gypsy</em> was schooner rigged
and in addition carried a big square sail on her
foremast.</p>

<p>For two days good time was made, but when
Raynor, with a rueful face, announced that only
a few shovelfuls more coal remained in the bunkers,
they were still many weary sea-miles from
their destination. However, sailors are proverbially
inclined to make the best of things. The
<em>Sea Gypsy’s</em> canvas was bent, and under a spanking
breeze they glided, at a fair speed, over the
sparkling waters, while in the engine room the
fires were drawn and the engines grew cold.</p>

<p>But a steam vessel, while she will behave fairly
well under canvas, is not designed for sail and
makes an astonishing amount of what sailors call
“lee-way,” that is, the wind, if it blows a’beam,
constantly drives her side-ways, or crab-fashion,
of a direct course, so that for every mile she
makes in a forward direction a considerable
amount of lee-way has to be deducted. For this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
reason all hands looked forward to a long and
tedious voyage before the highlands of Tahiti
were sighted.</p>

<p>Now that there was no doubt as to the fate of
the <em>Centurion</em>, and no danger of her being captured,
the <em>Sea Gypsy’s</em> wireless was set to work
again. But they were traveling a lonely tract of
the Pacific, and no answer came to Jack’s
messages, nor did he “listen in” on any outside
conversations.</p>

<p>Captain Sparhawk was in hopes of encountering
an English, French or German cruiser, for
all those nations keep war craft in these Pacific
waters to watch out for pearl pirates and other
law-breakers, but the wireless failed to pick any
up, although Jack worked it assiduously.</p>

<p>For two days the favoring breeze that was helping
the crippled <em>Sea Gypsy</em> along held. Then
there fell a flat calm, and the glass began to drop
ominously. Captain Sparhawk went about with
a grave face. Jack gathered from a few remarks
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
the reserved seaman had let fall, that he expected
another hurricane. Situated as she was, the <span class='it'>Sea
Gypsy’s</span> predicament would be a serious one if
such a tornado as the one she had safely weathered
were to strike her now. The sailors stood
about in little knots discussing the situation and
casting anxious glances at the horizon. Mr.
Jukes and the captain and officers spent long
hours on the bridge in careful consultation.</p>

<p>Before the sun set, the question as to whether
or no the <em>Sea Gypsy</em> was in for a second fight
with the elements was definitely settled. Thunder
and lightning deafened and blinded the voyagers.
Rain descended as only tropical rain can,
flooding the decks and blinding the look-outs and
the officers on the bridge. The <em>Sea Gypsy’s</em> canvas
was reduced, only enough being kept on to
keep her from literally rolling her hull under the
towering water mountains.</p>

<p>The crew clawed their way about the decks
by holding fast to life-lines which Captain
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
Sparhawk had ordered stretched when the storm
broke. Raynor, coming on deck to report that all
was well below, met Jack on his way back to the
lower regions of the ship.</p>

<p>“Well, old fellow, this is a corker and no mistake,”
he observed, raising his voice in order to
make it audible above the frantic battle noises
of the storm.</p>

<p>“It’s the worst yet,” Jack agreed.</p>

<p>“And it will be worse than ever before it gets
better, according to the way Captain Sparhawk
put it when I reported to him,” said the young
engineer.</p>

<p>“Hullo, what’s that?” exclaimed Jack suddenly.</p>

<p>“We hit something,” shouted Raynor. “Look
at the watch running forward.”</p>

<p>“Storm or no storm, I’m going forward to
see what’s up,” ejaculated Jack, and, followed by
Raynor, he hurried toward the bow where several
of the oil-skin coated crew were already clustered.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span><h2 id='t1340'>CHAPTER VIII.—“LAND, HO!”</h2></div>

<p>It was a fight every inch of the way, but at
last they reached the bow and found the sailors
bending over the recumbent form of a youth.</p>

<p>“What has happened? What did we strike?”
asked Jack of one of the sailors.</p>

<p>“Struck a small boat,” was the reply. “How
it ever lived in this sea is a wonder. This fellow
was in it.”</p>

<p>“Is he all right?”</p>

<p>“No; about half dead,” rejoined the third mate.
“Carry him aft, men, and put him in one of the
spare cabins. With care he may pull through.
I’m going to notify the captain,” and he hurried
off.</p>

<p>Several men picked up the form of the rescued
one. Jack suddenly saw his face, pale as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
death, with his wet hair hanging over his forehead.</p>

<p>“Great guns, Billy!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“What is it? What’s the matter? Do you
know him?” queried Raynor.</p>

<p>“Know him? I should say so. So do you. It’s
Harvey Thurman.”</p>

<p>“Impossible.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Take a look at him yourself.”</p>

<p>“By George, you are right. What a strange
happening,” declared Raynor, after taking one
glance at the youth the crew were bearing off.</p>

<p>“What in the world can he be doing in this
part of the ocean in a small boat?” wondered
Jack.</p>

<p>“I’ve no idea. We’ll have to wait till he comes
to, if he ever does. I remember hearing now
that he had got a job on a Pacific steamer. Perhaps
it had been wrecked and he was a castaway.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” agreed Jack. “I’m glad we saved
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
him, although he has made a lot of trouble for us
in the past.”</p>

<p>As readers of “The Ocean Wireless Boys and
the Naval Code” will recall, it was Harvey
Thurman who was assistant wireless man on the
<em>Columbia</em> and whose dislike of Jack and Billy resulted
in his joining their enemies in an effort to
discredit them. After the stolen code was recovered,
Thurman was not, like the rest engaged
in the rascally business, sent to prison, but was
allowed to go free at the boys’ behest, as they
believed he had been badly influenced more than
anything else.</p>

<p>“So you know him?” said Captain Sparhawk,
as they all stood in the cabin to which Thurman
had been taken and restoratives were administered
to the unfortunate youth.</p>

<p>“Indeed we do,” said both boys, and they told
the captain something of their experiences.</p>

<p>“He is not a desirable character then?” said
the captain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>“I wouldn’t say that,” said Jack. “We thought
he was influenced by bad companions. But at any
rate he had no liking for us. Is he going to get
better?”</p>

<p>“I think so. See, he is opening his eyes.”</p>

<p>Thurman’s face, under the influence of the restoratives,
had become suffused by a faint flush
of color. He looked wildly about him. As his
gaze rested first on Jack and then on Raynor he
looked like a sleeper newly awakened from a
night-mare.</p>

<p>“Gracious, am I dreaming?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“No, my lad,” said the captain, “but you had
a close call from going into a sleep from which
you never would have awakened.”</p>

<p>“But Ready and Raynor! What are they doing
here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re solid enough. Nothing ghostly
about us,” Jack assured him, extending his hand.
“Congratulations on your narrow escape from
death, and—and we’ll let bygones be bygones.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>“I never meant to be really bad,” said Thurman
weakly.</p>

<p>“Say no more about it,” advised Billy. “But
tell us how you came to be adrift in such a fearful
storm in that dinky little boat.”</p>

<p>“Better let him eat some soup first,” said the
captain, taking a steaming bowl from the steward,
from whom he had ordered it for the relief
of the castaway, “he’s half starved.”</p>

<p>The way in which Thurman gulped down the
grateful food showed that this statement was no
exaggeration.</p>

<p>“That’s the first food I’ve had in two days,” he
declared. “You see, when the <em>Galilee</em>, that was
the schooner I was on board of, sank in the storm
some days ago, I escaped in the boat. We
launched two altogether, but I guess the other one
was lost.”</p>

<p>“Begin at the beginning,” suggested Jack.</p>

<p>“All right then. It was this way, Ready:
After my—er—my little trouble with you I came
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
west. I got a job as assistant wireless man at a
lonely station on one of the Caroline Islands. But
I couldn’t stand the life and resigned. No regular
steamers touch there, so I got passage on the
<em>Galilee</em>, a little trading schooner for Papeiti.
She sprang a leak and sank, and there was only
a loaf of bread and a few cans of meat in the
boat when I shoved off from the sinking hulk.
It was all I had time to put in. What happened
after that till you bumped into me and saved me
is like a bad dream. I guess I was crazy most
of the time. I never expected to be saved, and—and
I guess it has been a good lesson to me.”</p>

<p>“If it has made you resolve to reform, it will
not have been wasted,” said Jack. And he then
told Thurman something about themselves. Captain
Sparhawk promised that as soon as Thurman
was stronger he would find a job for him, for the
boys’ old enemy was penniless, having left his
wallet behind him in his haste at fleeing from the
sinking schooner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>All that night the tempest raged with unabated
fury. At times it seemed as if the yacht must go
to pieces, so sadly was she wrenched and buffeted
by the giant combers. There was little sleep for
any on board that night and the day broke wildly
on a worried, harried-looking crew. Shortly before
noon the foresail tore away from the bolt
ropes, and split with a noise like the explosion of
a cannon. This accident was almost immediately
followed by a shout from the lookout.</p>

<p>“Land, ho!”</p>

<p>This cry, ordinarily one hailed with delight by
sailors, was not thus received on the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>.
Captain Sparhawk had been unable to get an
observation during the days of storm, and what
with this, and the heavy lee drift made by the
yacht, he had no idea of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>At the shout all hands clambered to points of
vantage to see what islands they could be approaching.
As the <em>Sea Gypsy</em> rose dizzily on the
top of a great wave Jack saw, with a flash of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
alarm, that they were headed straight for a large
island dotted with tropical verdure and tall, wind-bent
palms about which rocks bristled menacingly
like hungry fangs awaiting to penetrate the <span class='it'>Sea
Gypsy’s</span> stout hull.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span><h2 id='t1532'>CHAPTER IX.—THROUGH HIDDEN DANGERS.</h2></div>

<p>Critical moments followed. Captain Sparhawk
navigated the <em>Sea Gypsy</em> among the rocks
with marvelous seamanship. Time and again a
shout of dismay went up from the sailors as the
yacht almost grazed some huge black rock or
scraped a coral reef. But the passage was negotiated
with safety, and finally the sea-battered
yacht lay snug and safe in the lee of the island
and all hands drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>“Let go the anchor,” came the command, and
the cable roared out of the hawser holes with a
savage shout, as if of joy, at the ship’s delivery.</p>

<p>“Where under the sun are we?” asked Mr.
Jukes of Captain Sparhawk, as soon as these
maneuvers had been completed.</p>

<p>“I have no more idea than you, sir,” was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
reply. “But it looks to me as if this island must
be one of the Pamatous.”</p>

<p>“One of the pearl islands?” asked the millionaire.</p>

<p>“The very same. But I cannot be sure. Islands
are sown pretty thickly in this part of the
Pacific.”</p>

<p>“Are the Pamatou people cannibals?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” said the captain, “but before
I send a boat ashore I am going to deal out arms
to the landing party. We want to run no risks.
I shall also put a guard on the ship, for these
savages are great thieves and they might see a
chance for some piratical tricks in our dilemma.”</p>

<p>“The machine gun will come in handy then,”
said Mr. Jukes.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, sir. I’ll give orders to have it
mounted at once in a conspicuous place so if
any of the gentry ashore have any rascally
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
designs they can see we’re ready for them with a
dose of cold lead.”</p>

<p>Jack, after some difficulty, secured permission
for himself and Raynor to go ashore with the
landing party. Mr. Jukes, who remained on
board, was unwilling that they take the risk of
a hostile attack, but at last he yielded, and the
boys, in high glee, buckled on cartridge belts and
selected rifles from the ship’s armory.</p>

<p>“Keep the rifles in the bottom of the boat,”
ordered the captain, as they shoved off, “and
don’t use them unless you absolutely have to.”</p>

<p>Although the place where they lay was sheltered,
the storm was still howling and shrieking
above the island and the sea ran rather high. The
inclement weather, no doubt, explained why no
natives had so far been seen.</p>

<p>A landing was successfully made in the surf,
the men leaping from the boat and dragging her
ashore, waist-deep in water. Dense foliage,
among which could be seen the huge fronds of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
the banana, and broad-leaved breadfruit trees
grew almost down to the dazzlingly white beach.
Further back great palms, laden with cocoanuts,
towered majestically above the tropic growth.</p>

<p>“There seems to be no sign of a village here,”
said the captain.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is on the other side of the island,”
suggested Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll tramp along the beach and see
what we can find,” decided the man in command
of the “expedition.”</p>

<p>Four men were told off to guard the boat, with
orders to fire three shots if anything out of the
way occurred. The party in search of the village
was to signal in the same way if anything
untoward happened and they needed help.</p>

<p>“Shall we carry the rifles?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes; but try to conceal them as much as possible,”
counseled the captain.</p>

<p>They set off along the beach, walking briskly,
for the sand was firm and hard. Looking back
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
at the anchored yacht, they could see the glitter
of the machine-gun with a man stationed beside
it. The gun was trained on the shore ready for
instant use against any possible attack. After
traversing a short distance they came in sight of
what appeared to be a pathway. The condition
of it showed that it was much traveled and probably
it formed the high road to the village.</p>

<p>Captain Sparhawk decided to follow it. In
single file the adventurers advanced along the
track which wound in and out, dodging trees and
rocks in a manner peculiar to most savage trails
whose makers would rather go round an obstacle
than clear it out of the way. There was a
gloomy sky overhead and the wind boomed dolefully
among the palms, making a noise like sheets
of rain falling as their big fan-like leaves rustled
and scraped against each other.</p>

<p>A hundred rods or so from the coast they
found themselves in a ravine which towered up
steeply on each side of the track. This canyon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
appeared to penetrate the centre of the island, the
interior of which was hilly.</p>

<p>“I guess the village, if there is one, must be
clear round the other side of the island,” said
Billy Raynor, between bites at a banana he had
picked from a bush at the side of the trail. Others
of the party were munching on oranges and
a fruit the captain called a “custard apple,” the
latter a large, brown-colored “apple,” filled with
a yellow paste that looked and tasted like custard.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing certain, the high cost of
living need never worry these fellows,” remarked
Jack.</p>

<p>“Not if they’re content to be vegetarians,” said
Billy.</p>

<p>“They don’t need to be that,” said the captain,
“the seas hereabouts teem with fish—and look
there!”</p>

<p>There was a rush and a clatter of falling stones
just ahead of them as a flock of goats, half-wild
creatures, with wonderfully agile legs, leaped
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
up the sides of the canyon and then, at a safe
height, stood gazing down at the invaders of the
island.</p>

<p>“These South Sea islanders prefer goat’s meat
to anything except pork,” said the captain; “in
fact, the cannibals pay the doubtful compliment
to human flesh of calling it 'long pig.’”</p>

<p>This mention of cannibalism made the boys
feel rather uncomfortable. Although the captain
reassured them and they knew that the horrible
practice of eating human flesh had all but
died out in the South Seas, except in some remote
islands, they did not know but the one they were
exploring might prove to be one of the latter.
It was just as their minds were busy with these
disquieting thoughts that Jack gave a sharp exclamation
and came to a halt.</p>

<p>The fronds of a banana tree had parted suddenly
in front of the lad who was in advance of
the party.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>Between the green leaves a hideous face,
daubed with red and white paint, suddenly glared
out at the boy and then, as swiftly, vanished.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span><h2 id='t1715'>CHAPTER X.—CHUMMING WITH SAVAGES.</h2></div>

<p>So quickly had this happened that none of the
others had seen it. But Jack quickly apprised
them of his discovery.</p>

<p>“If the man’s face was painted, would that
mean he was on the war-path?” asked Billy
rather nervously.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily,” rejoined the captain, “but
still, he might be hostile. On feast days the natives
paint themselves up and that may have been
the reason for his decorations.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! He was hideous enough to stop a
clock or scare a locomotive off the track,” exclaimed
Jack.</p>

<p>“The village must be near at hand,” said the
captain presently. “Let us press on.”</p>

<p>They had reached the end of the ravine now,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
having crossed almost the entire island. The
path widened and others branched off from it.
But they stuck to the main thoroughfare and in
a few moments came in sight of a native village
lying not far back from the shore and amidst a
grove of magnificent palms.</p>

<p>The rhythmical throbbing of tom-toms reached
their ears and they could see natives dancing in
their peculiar swaying manner to the sound of
the skin drums. Suddenly the dancing ceased.
The natives in a swarm, among them the man
with the painted face, descended on the travelers.
Many wore flowers in their hair and others added
to these decorations by brass rings in their noses
and ear-rings composed of old china door knobs.
The men were remarkably handsome and the
women pretty.</p>

<p>After the first uncertainty as to their reception,
there was no doubt of their friendliness as they
pressed about. Several of them could talk English
and the captain soon learned that they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
indeed on one of the Pamatou group, as he had
surmised. The village, which was celebrating a
feast day, was one of two on the island occupied
by pearl fishers. The natives were civilized;
schooners and ships frequently touching there.
To the south of them they said were “bad men,”
meaning cannibals, and the boys were glad they
had not landed on one of them.</p>

<p>Nothing would do but that the white men must
sit down and partake of the feast which was just
ready. The boys stuffed themselves with roast
pork, goat-meat, sweet potatoes, yams, roasted
bread-fruit, fish and fruit. They washed this
down with cocoanut milk. During the meal, a
young Pamatouan attached himself to each of the
boys. Each of these lads was about sixteen and
wore, like most of the rest, a single white garment,
although some of the natives sported trousers,
and a few even had shoes—which they carried
in their hands!</p>

<p>The two lads, who had thrust their services
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
on Jack and Billy, informed them that they were
their friends and would be so all the time the
<em>Sea Gypsy</em> lay at the island. They waited on the
amused boys hand and foot, not letting them do
anything. Jack’s acquisition was called Bolabola;
Billy’s savage servitor was called, so he said,
Anai. Each could speak a little English and they
informed the boys that they were “their friends
for always.” From the captain the lads learned
that this is a common custom among the islanders
who value the friendship of a white man highly,
and think it an honor and a credit to wait on him.
He suggested giving them some little presents.
Jack presented Bolabola with a pocket-knife and
Billy gave Anai a fountain pen, having nothing
else with him. Anai promptly stuck the pen
through a big hole bored in the lobe of his ear
and capered about delighted with his new ornament.</p>

<p>When it came time to go back to the ship, the
friendly natives could not hear of the adventurers
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
trudging back on foot. A great war canoe was
launched and paddled by fifty strapping natives,
singing musically, and so they were paddled
round the island in state. On their arrival at
the ship, the boat which had been left under guard
was signalled to return, and presents of calico,
straw hats, cheap cutlery and glass beads and
fish-hooks and lines,—the latter highly prized,—were
dealt out from the yacht’s stores. The natives
swarmed all over the ship and it was hard
to induce them to leave at all. As for Bolabola
and Anai, they refused to go till they had extracted
promises from their “friends,” Jack and
Billy, to visit them ashore and visit a pearl cave
they knew of along the coast.</p>

<p>This exactly suited the boys, and their delight,
when Mr. Jukes decided to stay at the island for
some days, was unbounded. The reason for the
decision to remain there was arrived at after the
millionaire had held a consultation with Captain
Sparhawk. Tahiti was not far off, and that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
night Jack was ordered to raise the wireless station
on the French island and find out if a small
vessel could not be despatched at once with coal
to replenish the <em>Sea Gypsy’s</em> exhausted bunkers.</p>

<p>The next morning Jack had the satisfaction of
informing Mr. Jukes that the details had been
arranged and that a small tramp steamer might
be expected to come to their relief in a few days.
The expense was considerable, but this did not
appear to bother Mr. Jukes, who chafed at the
delay in his search for the survivors, if any there
were, of the <em>Centurion</em>.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span><h2 id='t1846'>CHAPTER XI.—THE CAVE OF THE PEARLS.</h2></div>

<p>Two days later, following the arrival at the
island of the coal ship—a small, rusty tramp
steamer—the boys set out for the village to meet
their friends, who had swum out to the ship almost
daily, despite the sharks, to see the white
youths. As they left the yacht they saw Thurman,
who had been put to work in the crew, laboring
with the other blackened “hands” at getting
the fuel on board.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look as if he liked his job much,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“He ought to be glad he’s alive,” supplemented
Billy Raynor. “I wonder if he has really mended
his ways or if it was just the effect of his scare
that made him promise to reform.”</p>

<p>“Impossible to say,” replied Jack, “but time
will show, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>The boys found their friends on the beach with
a long, cranky-looking canoe, paddled with wonderfully
carved paddles. In the canoe were
bananas, roast pork and other delicacies; also
several empty cocoanut shells.</p>

<p>“What are those for?” asked Jack, looking at
the latter.</p>

<p>“We put um pearl in them if so be we get any,”
grinned Anai.</p>

<p>“Do you really think we’ll get any?” asked
Billy.</p>

<p>“No can say. Think cave good place. You
ready?”</p>

<p>“Whenever you are,” said Jack, taking his
place in the canoe, while Billy followed his example.
The two native lads shoved off and sprang
on board with wonderful agility, driving the
canoe through the surf and up onto the summit
of a huge wave, where it hung poised for an instant
like a bird. The next moment they had
shot with powerful strokes through the rollers
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
and were out beyond the danger line of the surf.</p>

<p>They passed through a noisy fleet of fishers, all
of whom greeted them, and then the canoe was
headed for a green headland some distance down
the coast. The sun glowed fiercely overhead, the
surf boomed unceasingly on the beach and the
reef beyond, the water hissed along the sides of
the canoe as the two athletic young natives urged
forward amid shouts.</p>

<p>Looking over the side, Jack could see the coral
bottom as clearly as if an inch instead of many
feet of water separated it from the frail canoe.
It was almost as if they were floating in the air.
Fish of brilliant colors darted about and once a
dark, sinister shade appeared beneath the canoe.
The Kanaka boys shouted and beat the water
with their paddles. The dark shadow melted
away.</p>

<p>“Him very bad shark,” said Anai. “White
men call him tiger shark. Worst kind of all
shark.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>“I’d hate to bathe around here,” observed Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, him all right, most generally scare him
away, kick, splash, makee big noise, he go 'way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but suppose he refused to be scared,” objected
Billy.</p>

<p>“Then maybe he takee off leg, arm, maybe
swallow you all up.”</p>

<p>The long, curved point soon hid the fishers in
front of the village from view. Rounding it, they
found themselves skimming along a coast of surpassing
beauty. Steep, majestic cliffs arose from
the clear water and long green creepers from the
forest above trailed over them.</p>

<p>At last the prow of the canoe was turned and
the boys saw that the furious paddlers were heading
at top speed for the cliffs.</p>

<p>“Hey, stop that, you’ll smash the canoe!” cried
Jack, as, without any diminution of speed, the
canoe was urged with wild shouts from the paddlers
right at the rocky escarpment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>“They’ve gone crazy,” exclaimed Billy,
“they——”</p>

<p>He did not conclude what he was going to say.
Instead, he set up a cry of alarm as the prow of
the canoe was hurled at the cliff at a spot where
a regular curtain of lianas and other forest trailers
depended from above.</p>

<p>Swish, whoosh, went the canoe, as it shot
through the parasites and creepers. The boys
instinctively ducked their heads. Instead of being
dashed to destruction against the cliff, the
frail craft had been guided into this singular cave,
one of many along the coast, through the greenery
portal. Both the Kanaka boys set up a shout
of laughter at the expense of Jack and Billy, who
looked rather sheepish at their late alarm.</p>

<p>They were in a dark passage that led into an
inner water cave filled with an eternal sunless twilight
that was very refreshing to them after the
heat and glare outside. The canoe shot through
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
the passage and into the cave itself, the boys uttering
a shout of admiration the while.</p>

<p>“Look,” said Anai, pointing upward.</p>

<p>Overhead was a marvelously perfect, natural
dome, with a large hole in the centre through
which shafts of sunlight fell into the cave and
were reflected from the water with a greenish
light.</p>

<p>“Look,” ordered the Kanaka boy again.</p>

<p>The boys obeyed and gazed over the side of the
canoe. Below them, through several feet of crystal-clear
water, they could see bowers of coral,
white and pink, with fish darting in and out of
the chinks and crossing prismatically, while others
hung motionless as if suspended, fanning the
water incessantly with their gauzy fins. It was
the most wonderful water picture the boys had
ever seen.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span><h2 id='t1998'>CHAPTER XII.—A TRAP!</h2></div>

<p>“We eat. Then we go get pearls,” decided
Anai.</p>

<p>The boys, whose appetites had been sharpened
by the trip, were not averse to this, and they made
a hearty meal. After it the two native boys produced
leaves in which betel nuts had been carefully
wrapped up and offered them to Jack and
Billy, both of whom declined them. But Anai and
his friend began chewing the spicy nuts with
great zest.</p>

<p>A canoe-length from where they floated a clear
rill of water stole noiselessly down from above,
mingling its sweet waters with the sea. After
demolishing their betel nuts, the chewing of
which is a well-nigh universal custom in the
South Seas, the two native boys stood erect and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
then bound their long black hair in knots on the
top of their heads.</p>

<p>Then, with a shout, they balanced gracefully
for a second on the edge of the canoe and plunged
over. They floated for a minute or two and then
dived, after inhaling immense breaths. To the
boys, watching the divers through the clear water,
it looked as if they were literally climbing down,
head first, through the pellucid depths.</p>

<p>Then they saw both the Kanaka lads wrenching
oyster shells from their hold on the coral with
furious energy. It seemed impossible that they
could stay under water as long as they did, but
at length, even their wonderful endurance gave
out and, laden with shells, they shot back to the
surface.</p>

<p>Reaching the canoe, the two divers hung almost
exhausted on the outrigger, regaining their
breath after they had thrown several oysters into
the canoe, which the boys opened eagerly, but only
two small pearls rewarded them. The two Kanaka
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
boys showed plainly the stress of the long time
they had stayed down. Their eyes were bloodshot
and their faces suffused. Their veins stood
out on their bodies like cords.</p>

<p>The boys begged them not to go down again,
but they insisted.</p>

<p>“How often do you mean to dive?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“One, maybe two, three time,” said Anai.</p>

<p>“Nobody can dive more than three time,” declared
the other. “Him bad if dive too many
time. Makee much sick.”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” said Jack. “I wouldn’t
have thought it possible for any one to stay down
so long. It’s wonderful.”</p>

<p>The next two dives yielded three more pearls
from a dozen or more oysters. None of them
were of any great value but the two divers insisted
on presenting them to the boys.</p>

<p>“Me try get you very good pearl some udder
day,” promised Anai, and his companion nodded
to show that he meant to help in the enterprise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>“Hullo, what’s that?” asked Jack suddenly,
after they had chatted and rested for some time
and began to think about returning. There was
a booming sound in the air and the waters of the
cave began to become agitated, rocking the
canoe dangerously.</p>

<p>Overhead, through the dome, they could see
that the sky had darkened.</p>

<p>“Me think storm come. Better get out of
here,” said Anai, looking troubled. “Him bad
time of year for storms.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, I should say so,” declared Jack.
“We’ve been in two bad ones already.”</p>

<p>“That’s how we got blown here,” added Billy.</p>

<p>“We thinkee that good storm blow you here,
white boys,” said Anai.</p>

<p>The sky grew darker, and every now and then
a big roller entirely filled the mouth of the cavern,
blinding them with spray. Having spent its fury,
these great waves retired with a concussion that
was deafening, dragging the canoe with fearful
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
velocity toward the mouth of the cave by its suction.
At such times they only saved themselves
from being swept out to sea by grasping the
hanging curtain of creepers and vines. Anai and
his companion baled the canoe with a big shell,
but the boys felt that their position was an awkward
and even a dangerous one.</p>

<p>Another great wave burst, sealing up the cave
as if it was an air-tight compartment, and making
the waters of the cavern boil and seethe furiously.
The pressure of air caused by the sudden rush of
water affected the boys’ ears as if they had been
suddenly placed in a caisson.</p>

<p>“This is terrible,” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“Something will have to be done,” said Billy.
“We can’t last in here much longer.”</p>

<p>“Are we in danger, Anai?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“We in very bad fix; but we getee out all right,”
the Kanaka assured him, stopping his bailing.</p>

<p>“They’ve got some plan in their head,” decided
Jack, and sat down in the bottom of the cranky,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
frail canoe to see what the next move was to be.
It was a startling one. The two youths seized
their paddles and then, as the next wave receded,
they shot out of the mouth of the cave like a bomb
from a mortar, before either Jack or Billy could
guess their intention or stop what seemed sheer
madness on the Kanakas’ part, and placed all their
lives in grave danger. Outside they found themselves
in the teeth of a howling gale. Spray
blinded them, flying over them in sheets.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said, nothing seen. The air
was darkened with flying spume. It seemed impossible
that the canoe could live a minute.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span><h2 id='t2145'>CHAPTER XIII.—ON THE REEF.</h2></div>

<p>The two lads crouched, drenched through, on
the bottom of the canoe, while the Kanaka boys
paddled furiously. Giant waves, true mountains
of water, hung above them threatening to engulf
them, but the canoe rode them with what appeared
incredible buoyancy.</p>

<p>How long this kept up, neither Jack nor Billy
ever knew. It seemed like years. Dizzy and sick
from the riotous motions of the canoe as it swung
wildly between sea and sky, they lost all count of
everything. But the struggle was nearing its
end.</p>

<p>Suddenly a giant comber caught up the dugout,
turtled it skyward and then rushed it sickeningly
down. It lifted the craft over the reef and
into the open sea. For one instant it hesitated
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
and then spun round in the trough of the sea.
The next moment it was smashed into slivers
against the reef while an avalanche of waters carried
all its occupants down into the depths before
they had time to even shout their consternation.
More dead than alive, Jack shot back to the surface
again. Not far from him was a projecting
point of the reef. He managed somehow to crawl
to it, but as he made his progress along the lower
lying portions of the coral wall he was swept time
and again by waves and compelled to exert all
his strength to avoid being dashed off. At length,
with hands cut and bleeding from the rough coral,
and his clothing in shreds, he reached his refuge
and was almost immediately joined there, to his
great relief, by Anai and his comrade, who had
rescued Billy Raynor.</p>

<p>But it was a miserable refuge they had found.
The projecting point of rock hardly gave room
for all of them, and frequently waves swept over
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
it. At all times they were choked and blinded
with spray.</p>

<p>“Well, this is the limit,” declared Billy.
“Never again for me so far as pearl hunting is
concerned.”</p>

<p>“Nor for me either,” said Jack. “Still, it was
our fault for not watching the weather.”</p>

<p>“How long will the storm last, Anai, do you
think?” inquired Billy, a little later.</p>

<p>The Kanaka boy looked at the weather with a
practiced eye.</p>

<p>“Him get better soon,” he said. “Him not bad
storm.”</p>

<p>“Not a bad storm!” exclaimed Jack. “Well, if
this isn’t one, I never want to see one.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes hurricane season come blow whole
village away,” Anai assured him.</p>

<p>“I hope this won’t be a hurricane,” said Jack.</p>

<p>The Kanaka shook his head.</p>

<p>“Bimeby him go way,” he assured them. “Look
blue sky way off there now.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>Sure enough, in the far north-west, from
whence the hurricane had come, a shaft of sunlight
was striking the sea. Behind them they
could see the storm retreating. Before long the
sea had quieted down and the wind dropped almost
completely.</p>

<p>“Well, we are better off in one respect,” said
Jack, as they lay about on the reef, basking in the
hot sun and drying their wet garments, “but how
are we to get ashore?”</p>

<p>The question was answered by Anai.</p>

<p>“Me swim, get canoe. Soon back,” he said.</p>

<p>The next moment his lithe brown form was in
the water. To protect himself against sharks, he
carried a long knife, fashioned out of iron wood,
which was slung round his neck by a lanyard. It
was as tough and hard as steel, and he appeared
to have no doubt that he could protect himself
with it against the great fish.</p>

<p>Half-way to the shore a triangular fin came
cruising near him and the boys dreaded to see a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
tragic end to their island friend. But Anai set
up diabolical yells and kicked up a great splashing
in the water and the sea monster sheered off
again.</p>

<p>“Shark him big coward,” said Anai’s friend,
who had remained behind with the boys. Directly
Anai landed he turned and waved and then
set off at a sharp run along the beach. Before
they expected him he was back again with a
canoe, and thus an adventure which might have
had disastrous consequences ended safely. But
it was a long time before the boys ever forgot it.</p>

<p>The next morning Jack and Billy were leaning
over the rail of the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>, chatting and
watching the sharks that swum around the ship
eagerly watching for scraps from the galley.
The coal was nearly all unloaded from the small,
rusty tramp that had brought it, and all hands
were looking forward to a resumption of the
journey.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Jukes had been investigating
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
ashore and learned, from some natives,
that the “Tear of the Sea” had actually been
bought by his brother, and that just after the purchase,
the <em>Centurion</em> had sailed away. Not long
after, ‘Bully’ Broom’s ship arrived, and the sea
rover was informed of the sale. He was furious
as it appeared that, in accordance with his usual
practice, he intended to raid the village and take
possession of the wonderful pearl by force. Mr.
Jerushah Jukes’ arrival ahead of him had, of
course, frustrated this plan. According to the
best information he could get, the millionaire
learned that “Bully” had at once put to sea in
pursuit of the <em>Centurion</em>. The finding of the
empty derelict left little doubt that he had attacked
the schooner and imprisoned, or worse,
perhaps killed, all those on board her.</p>

<p>This, in its way, was well enough, but it left
the fate of the party still a mystery, and their
whereabouts unknown, for “Bully” had half a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
dozen retreats scattered through the South Seas
where he might have taken them, for even Captain
Sparhawk did not believe that the ruffian
would have dared to kill them.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span><h2 id='t2300'>CHAPTER XIV.—BATTLING MAN-EATING SHARKS.</h2></div>

<p>“Like a chance to catch one uv them bastes,
Mishther Riddy?” asked Tim Muldoon, the Irish
quarter-master of the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>, who paused
near where the boys were standing watching a
mighty commotion in the water made by two
great tiger sharks fighting desperately over a
piece of spoiled pork that had been thrown overboard.</p>

<p>“What would we do with it when we had it?”
asked Jack with a smile.</p>

<p>“Shure there’s a certain part of the cratirs that
makes illigint ateing. Meself and several other
la-ads in ther crew wouldn’t have iny objictions
at all, at all to a bit of shar-ark steak if so be
y’u’d loike to hook one.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, Billy?” asked Jack.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>“That it would be good fun. But what sort
of a rig do you use? No use taking an eight-ounce
rod and a dry fly or a hand line to those
fellows.”</p>

<p>“Shure oi’ve got a foine shar-ark hook up forward.
I’ll go git it fer yez,” declared Muldoon,
hurrying off.</p>

<p>He was back before long with a hook that
looked like one of those used by butchers on
which to hang whole carcasses. Attached to this
was a length of steel chain with a swivel, and
above a stout rope some hundred feet in length.
Billy Raynor went below to the cook’s quarters
and soon came back with a big chunk of pork
which was stuck on the hook.</p>

<p>“How’ll we haul him out if we do get one?”
Billy wanted to know, as the bait struck the water
with a splash.</p>

<p>“Just give a holler and I’ll git some uv ther
byes uv ther crew to lind yez a hand,” declared
Muldoon. “Sure 'tis foine spor-rot ye’ll be hivin’
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
intirely—wow! murtha! Watch yersilf Misther
Raynor!”</p>

<p>There had come a sudden vicious rush of one
of the sea-monsters at the hook. Turning its
hideous jaws upward, the ravenous creature had
literally swallowed “hook, line and sinker.” It
happened that at that precise moment Billy alone
had hold of the rope.</p>

<p>As the shark’s jaws gripped the hook and its
sharp point sunk into his flesh, the creature made
a mighty rush. It caught Billy unprepared as
he stood by the rail, a section of which had been
removed while the crew polished the brass work.</p>

<p>Before he realised what was happening a coil
of the rope entangled his legs. Like a bullet from
a gun, he was whisked off the deck and through
the air into the sea, which Jack knew was alive
with sharks. It had all happened so suddenly
that the last of Muldoon’s alarmed cries had not
left his lips before poor Billy was towed away
from the ship by the maddened shark, unable to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
make a move to extricate himself. He was barely
able to breathe, in fact, being half submerged.</p>

<p>Paralyzed for an instant, Jack regained his
faculties with an effort. Captain Sparhawk, who
had seen the whole affair, was the first to take
definite action, however. He issued an order for
a boat to be lowered at once and then dashed
into his cabin for a pistol.</p>

<p>“Hurry, Sparhawk, for Heaven’s sake,” urged
Mr. Jukes, who had also been a witness of the
accident. “The poor lad will be drowned or eaten
alive by the other sharks if we don’t act
promptly.”</p>

<p>But the captain was already out of earshot.
Muldoon and two other sailors were at the oars
of the boat as he tumbled into it, followed by
Jack, who, in his haste, did not stop to ask permission
to come. Luckily, the shark, instead of
taking a straight course out to sea, was dashing
round and round in circles. This gave them a
chance to save Billy’s life, for had the great fish
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
pursued a straight course, Raynor’s fate would
undoubtedly have been sealed.</p>

<p>“Row for your lives, men,” urged the captain,
standing erect, pistol in hand, awaiting the first
opportunity for a shot at the shark.</p>

<p>“Shure thare’s no nade to till us thot, captain,
dear,” cried Muldoon. “We’ll git the poor lad
if we have to pull our own heads off.”</p>

<p>The shark now made a swift dash for the bow
of the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>. Behind him, at a distance of
about seventy-five feet, poor Billy’s body could
be seen being rushed through the water with a
“wake” behind it like that of a fast steamer.
Jack could see his chum’s face, which was ashen
white. But from the glimpse he had of it, the
young wireless man was sure that Billy was still
alive, marvelous though that seemed. For half
the time, owing to the manner in which he was
attached to the shark, the unfortunate lad’s head
was under the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Bang! Captain Sparhawk’s pistol spoke as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
shark crossed the bow of the boat which had
been instantly turned to follow the creature’s new
tactics.</p>

<p>“Missed,” he groaned.</p>

<p>“No,” cried Jack, an instant later. “See, the
water is red behind him! You hit him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I fear not mortally. These creatures
have an amazing grip on life,” was the
despondent reply.</p>

<p>And now a fresh element entered into the
scene. Round the bow of the yacht, toward
which the shark, with its human burden, was
dashing, there suddenly appeared a long, slender
canoe with two lithe young native figures propelling
it. It was Anai and his friend, the sworn
allies of the boys.</p>

<p>For an instant, as the extraordinary scene presented
itself to them, they stood like bronze figures.
Then the full meaning of the impending
tragedy appeared to strike them. With a simultaneous
cry each grasped his great iron-wood
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
knife and without the slightest hesitation leaped
overboard.</p>

<p>“They are going to save him!” cried Jack
exultingly, as the two Kanaka boys fearlessly
clove the shark-infested water to attack the monster
that had abducted Billy.</p>

<p>“And lose their own lives,” exclaimed the captain
as several dark fins appeared in the water
about the two intrepid youths.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span><h2 id='t2463'>CHAPTER XV.—A MESSAGE FROM THE DEEP.</h2></div>

<p>The scene that ensued was one that lingered
long in the recollection of those who saw it.
Uttering loud yells, the two native boys bore
down on the shark that had poor Billy in tow.</p>

<p>Each taking a side they dashed upon it with
fury. As they gained its flanks their arms
flashed up and the next instant their great iron-wood
knives were buried hilt-deep in the tough
skin. The watchers saw the great shark give
an upward leap and the water was dyed crimson.</p>

<p>“They reached his vitals. Hurrah for them,”
cried Captain Sparhawk. “Bear down on Billy,
lads. I reckon the shark is done for.”</p>

<p>They were none too soon. After being disentangled
from the rope that had caused all the
trouble, Billy was hauled into the boat just in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
the nick of time. The rope had grazed and
chafed his legs cruelly, but except for the great
amount of water in his lungs he had suffered no
other injury.</p>

<p>But no sooner had this been done than another
necessity arose. The brave Anai and his companion
were surrounded by a school of sharks
attracted by the blood of the creature the two
young Kanakas had despatched. So far, by
splashing furiously, and screeching at the top
of their voices, the native youths had succeeded
in keeping the monsters at bay, but it was doubtful
for how long they could do so.</p>

<p>“To the rescue, lads,” cried Captain Sparhawk,
replacing the cartridge he had discharged.
“Give way with a will. I wouldn’t wish to see
either of those brave lads harmed.”</p>

<p>In a few seconds they were in the midst of
the school of sharks that had assembled as if by
magic, ravenous for the flesh of their dead
brother. The captain’s pistol spat lead right and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
left, and at that short range the effect of the
bullets was deadly. In a few minutes five of
the sea monsters were dead. But far from being
scared off the rest fell furiously upon these,
making upward rushes, exposing their huge
mouths with their triple rows of needle-like teeth.</p>

<p>Leaving them to their cannibal feast, Anai and
his companion were hauled on board and at Muldoon’s
special request the body of the brute that
had almost caused Billy’s death was taken in tow.</p>

<p>“I’ll make you byes some handsome watch-charms
out of his teeth fer remimbrancers,” he
promised.</p>

<p>“As if we needed anything to remind us of
it,” shuddered Jack.</p>

<p>“Just think, if it hadn’t been for Anai here
and Bolabola I’d have been past saving by now,”
cried Billy, warmly ringing their hands.</p>

<p>“You may well say that, lad,” agreed the captain.
“They saved you from visiting Davy
Jones, without a doubt.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>“We your friends. Must save you even if it
cost our lives,” said Anai, looking embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Shure an’ thot’s more than many a white
man wud say,” approved Muldoon warmly. “Byes,
give us yer flippers. Ye may hav’ black skins,
but be jabers yer hearts is pure gold entoirely.”</p>

<p>The canoe was taken in tow and the whole
party returned to the yacht, where they received
more congratulations from the others on board
who had watched the whole affair spell-bound
with alarm and then with admiration at the
Kanaka boys’ brave act. The decks rang with
cheers as they came on board, Captain Sparhawk
and Jack supporting Billy, who was still white
and shaky.</p>

<p>Mr. Jukes’ enthusiasm for Anai and Bolabola
knew no bounds. The millionaire wanted them
to accept a handful of gold pieces each. But the
lads shook their heads. Gold was of little use
to them. But other presents which were showered
upon them they accepted gladly. There was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
almost a canoe-full of them, ranging from gaudy
neckties to a broken concertina, the latter being
presented by Muldoon. It could emit, upon coaxing,
a few wheezy notes, and the brown boys appeared
to prize it quite above any of their other
gifts.</p>

<p>In the meantime, on the foredeck, to which
the body of the great shark had been hoisted
by slings, the members of the crew, who understood
such operations, assisted by Muldoon, were
cutting up the monster. From time to time they
flung useless bits of offal over the side. A scramble
from such of the sharks as had disposed of
the dead bodies of their companions instantly
ensued. Sharks are the most rapacious of any
creatures on land or sea, and their appetites appeared
to have been slacked in no important particular
by their cannibal meal.</p>

<p>“Bad luck to yez,” exclaimed Muldoon, shaking
his fist at them after one of these rushes,
for every sailor hates a shark. “There’s many
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
a thrue lad gone to his long rickonin’ through
yez or yez mates. Bad cess to all uv yez, says
Tim Muldoon.”</p>

<p>An interested group, among whom were Jack
and Billy, watched the proceedings from the
bridge. Mr. Jukes was no less interested than
the rest. He attentively watched the sharks as
they fought. Perhaps their feverish rapacity
reminded him of certain “big business” operations
at home in the States where great corporations
have been not unknown to gobble up their
small competitors as hungrily as any tiger shark.</p>

<p>“Hullo, they seem to have found something
interesting,” said Jack, as a murmur arose among
the butchers who suddenly crowded round Muldoon,
chief of the dissectors.</p>

<p>“It’s a bottle,” cried Billy Raynor.</p>

<p>“Look here what I found in the hongry divil’s
stomach,” exclaimed Muldoon, holding up his
find. “Be jabers, he must hav’ a digestion a
dispiptic millionaire would invy to ——”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>He stopped short, covered with confusion, as
he suddenly recalled that Mr. Jukes suffered from
the very complaint he had mentioned.</p>

<p>“Bring that bottle here, Muldoon,” ordered
Captain Sparhawk, in order to save what threatened
to be an awkward situation, for Mr. Jukes
had turned as red as a turkey-cock and the boys
had had to turn away to hide their smiles.</p>

<p>The quartermaster hastened aft with the bottle.
It was encrusted with deposits apparently caused
by the acids of the shark’s stomach. But when
Captain Sparhawk held it to the light, he could
see that contained within it was some object.</p>

<p>“There’s something inside it,” he said.</p>

<p>“By jove, perhaps a letter from some shipwrecked
sailors,” exclaimed Mr. Jukes.</p>

<p>“Such messages are often frauds, sir,” observed
the captain. “If it should prove to be
such, I’d be wary about replying to it.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s have a look at it, whatever it is,”
said Mr. Jukes. “This is really interesting.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>They all crowded about, even the Kanakas,
as the captain smashed the bottle on the rail.
A rolled-up paper dropped on the deck. Jack, at
whose feet it had fallen, picked it up. He opened
it and saw that it was scribbled on with pencil.</p>

<p>“It seems ——,” he began, when a sudden
exclamation from Mr. Jukes checked his further
utterance.</p>

<p>“Let me look at that paper,” commanded the
millionaire, who, they now noticed, was breathing
quickly and whose eyes shone with feverish
excitement.</p>

<p>Jack handed it over, while they all regarded
the millionaire’s agitation curiously. With hands
that shook, the financier scanned the letter and
then made an electrifying announcement in a
voice that was tense and self-controlled, but yet
betrayed the excitement under which he labored
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, the age of miracles has not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
passed,” he said. “When Ready first opened the
paper, I thought I recognized a peculiar handwriting.
I was not wrong. This message was
written by my brother!”</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span><h2 id='t2673'>CHAPTER XVI.—ALIVE ON THE SEA.</h2></div>

<p>“Incredible!” exclaimed Captain Sparhawk,
unable to think of anything else to say at the
astounding information.</p>

<p>“But, nevertheless, true. Sparhawk, this message
confirms the truth of your theory about
‘Bully’ Broom. That rascal attacked and overcame
the unsuspecting crew of the <em>Centurion</em>, and
obtained the 'Tear of the Sea’.”</p>

<p>“The infernal scoundrel,” breathed Captain
Sparhawk. “There is not another man in the
South Seas who would have dared such a coup.
But does the message give any clue to your
brother’s fate, sir?” he added respectfully.</p>

<p>The millionaire’s face glowed and suddenly
lost its careworn look.</p>

<p>“That’s the best part of it,” he explained.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
“But come to my cabin, captain—yes, Ready, you
and Raynor may come, too,” he added as he intercepted
anxious looks on the boys’ faces.</p>

<p>Inside the cabin the millionaire spread on the
table the yellowed, scribbled bit of paper that
just then meant more to him than any document
he had ever seen in his life.</p>

<p>“I’ll read aloud,” he said, and then, in a clear
voice, he recited the contents of the missive.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Any one finding this please notify my brother
Jacob Jukes of New York, who will reward him
lavishly for the trouble. This is being written
on board ‘Bully’ Broom’s schooner, <span class='it'>South Sea
Lass</span>. We are all prisoners and the 'Tear of
the Sea’ is in the ruffian’s possession. We are
being taken, as I overheard, to Bomobori, in New
Guinea, with what object I cannot say. May
Heaven help us in our desperate strait. I am
throwing this, with a prayer to Heaven that it
may be found, from the window of the cabin in
which I am confined.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;font-variant:small-caps;'>Jerushah Jukes.”</p>

</div>

<p>“I know Bomobori well,” exclaimed Captain
Sparhawk, as Mr. Jukes finished reading. “I
was there in '87 and again in '89.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>“What sort of a place is it?” inquired Mr.
Jukes.</p>

<p>“Not much of a town,” was the reply. “It
is at the mouth of a river that penetrates a wild
country. If ‘Bully’ Broom wished to hide his
captives, he could not have taken them to a better
place.”</p>

<p>“Sparhawk,” and the millionaire’s voice was
vibrant with determination, “how long will it
take us to get there?”</p>

<p>“I should say not more than a week. But we
should have to re-coal at Tahiti if we are to
make the run at top speed. How about that,
Raynor?”</p>

<p>“You’re right, captain,” said the young engineer.
“I’ll guarantee to run the <em>Sea Gypsy’s</em>
engines faster than they were ever run before,
but I’ve got to have the coal to do it with.”</p>

<p>“That steamer is through coaling us now?”
asked the millionaire, after he had made a few
calculations on a scrap of paper.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>“They emptied the last of their load an hour
ago,” said Captain Sparhawk.</p>

<p>“Good,” was Mr. Jukes’ response. “Send
the captain to me and I will give him my check.
Raynor, how soon can you have steam up?”</p>

<p>“In an hour, sir,” responded the young engineer.</p>

<p>“Splendid; make all the time you can. Every
moment is valuable now. Ready——”</p>

<p>Jack was all attention. Into the millionaire’s
manner had come a snap and a grip of affairs
that had not been there since they had sailed. He
had something tangible to go upon now, and was
plainly prepared to make the most of it.</p>

<p>“Ready,” he went on, “I want you to raise
Tahiti at once. Order coal to be ready for us
when we arrive and have a force of men engaged
to hustle it on board without loss of time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” rejoined Jack, hurrying from the
cabin.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes the entire atmosphere
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
of the ship appeared to be charged with electricity
and bustle. Black smoke volleyed from
the stack and the roar of escaping steam soon
came from the relief pipe. Anai and his companion,
almost in tears at the thought of parting
with the boys, were sent ashore, and final preparations
made for the start.</p>

<p>Shortly before sun-down Raynor reported all
ready in the engine room.</p>

<p>“Very well, captain,” said Mr. Jukes, “you
may get up your anchor.”</p>

<p>The necessary orders were soon given and as
the chains rattled home through the exhaust
pipes the yacht swung her bow gracefully seaward.
A big crowd of canoes and the small
tramp, which had also taken up anchor, accompanied
her some distance out to sea.</p>

<p>The natives raised their voices in melancholy
songs as they paddled, and from time to time
cried out:</p>

<p>“Come back, white men.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>Among them Jack and Raynor recognized
Anai and the other young Kanaka. Both lads
felt a genuine regret at leaving the brave, likeable
young natives, but ahead of them they felt
lay experiences which for the time being put all
other emotions out of their minds. The <span class='it'>Sea
Gypsy</span>, rushing ahead at top speed, soon left the
rusty tramp, her consort, far behind. By dark
only the summit of the island was visible on the
horizon. It sank quickly from sight, and when
the first stars appeared the <em>Sea Gypsy</em> was alone
on the sea.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span><h2 id='t2827'>CHAPTER XVII.—AN ENCOUNTER AT BOMOBORI.</h2></div>

<p>It was on a clear day a little more than a
week later that the lookout announced land dead
ahead. All on board knew that it must be New
Guinea, the wild and little known country where
Mr. Jukes had confident hopes of finding his lost
brother. Captain Sparhawk made an excellent
“land-fall,” as sailors call it, and by night they
came to anchor off Bomobori.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful scene. The waves dashed
against a golden strand. Behind lay vast and
mysterious forests, looking dark and uninviting
in the evening light. Beyond the forests rose
great mountains veiled in the bluish mist of the
far distances. As darkness fell, the lights of
Bomobori began to twinkle, casting reflections
in the still waters of the harbor and river, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
mouth of which latter could be seen to the north
of the town.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m ready to go ashore,” remarked
Raynor, as he joined Jack on deck at the conclusion
of his duties in the engine-room. “It
will certainly feel good to put foot on shore once
more.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it will,” agreed Jack, warmly. “I’m
anxious to get a look at New Guinea too. It’s
a country about which very little is known—I
mean so far as the interior is concerned.”</p>

<p>“Well, we are likely to have plenty of opportunity
for exploration,” said Raynor. “I heard
Mr. Jukes telling the captain that he believed,
from what he had heard about ‘Bully’ Broom at
Tahiti where he is well known, that the rascal
has a secret hiding place in the interior somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s likely to take a long time to locate
him,” said Jack. “This is a pretty big country
and very densely wooded, with big mountains
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
and rivers galore. I’m afraid it’s a needle and
hay-stack job.”</p>

<p>“I expect Mr. Jukes means to get a clue in
Bomobori, where Broom is probably well known,”
hazarded Raynor.</p>

<p>“That is probably his idea,” said Jack. “Anyhow,
he is not a man who would give up his
purpose for any ordinary difficulties.”</p>

<p>It was decided not to leave the yacht till the
morning. It can well be imagined then that the
sleep of the boys that night was not as sound as
usual. Both lay awake wondering what lay before
them, and whether they would succeed or
fail in the mission, for that evening Mr. Jukes
had appointed them members of the expedition,
and declared that he would rely upon them to
the uttermost to aid him.</p>

<p>It was then that Jack had made a suggestion.
The yacht was to be left in the harbor with a
crew to guard her, but communication with her
might be important, even necessary, if they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
driven to some other part of the coast and were
unable to return to Bomobori.</p>

<p>Jack’s suggestion was that, with the spare
parts of the ship’s wireless, of which a big stock
was carried, he should construct a portable radio
apparatus by means of which they could at all
times be in touch with the yacht. He had an
idea that he could do this easily. Thurman, who
had been conducting himself in an irreproachable
manner, could be left in charge of the <span class='it'>Sea
Gypsy’s</span> plant with perfect safety, the boy felt
confident. And so, subject to his success with a
portable set, it was arranged.</p>

<p>“This doesn’t appear to be much of a town,”
observed Raynor, as they landed the next day, a
little before noon, in a warm, gentle shower of
rain such as frequently swept across the island
at that time of the year.</p>

<p>“Well, you could hardly expect to find it a
New York or London, you know,” rejoined Jack.</p>

<p>In truth Bomobori was a very fair specimen
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
of a town in that section of the world. Along
the water front, back of which squatted a line
of tin-roofed warehouses, were moored native
craft from up the river with bamboo cabins and
great lattice sails that housed a whole family
of natives. In spite of the rain it was warm
and steamy, and a strange assortment of odors
greeted their nostrils as the boat was run up to
the principal dock and made fast.</p>

<p>The population was a very mixed one. Pallid
white men, who looked like Frenchmen for the
most part, rubbed elbows on the water front with
Chinese, Lascars, Malays, Javanese and the wild-looking
Papuans from the interior with their
frizzed hair and ornamental cloaks of bird skins
and long spears. Here and there a stout German
in white ducks waddled by with a sun-helmeted
Englishman. There appeared to be quite a lot
of trading going on.</p>

<p>But they were anxious to hurry on to the hotel
where Mr. Jukes hoped to begin the inquiries
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_124' id='Page_124'>124</a></span>
which he was sanguine would result in his finding
his brother. The hostelry for which they
were bound lay some squares back from the
water front. It was situated, like most tropical
hotels, in a park in which flowers and shrubs
of all kinds grew luxuriantly, and bright colored
birds flew with harsh cries, like (bright) jewels,
among the brilliant foliage. It was a two-story
affair in front of which a fountain plashed coolingly
in the hot, heavy air. Verandas, upon which
every room opened, completely surrounded each
story.</p>

<p>They entered the office where the hand baggage
they had brought was picked up by barefooted,
white-garmented servants. Mr. Jukes
was bending over the register writing his name
and those of his party when Jack caught sight
of somebody lounging in a bamboo chair in the
reading room that nearly took his breath away.</p>

<p>“Well, if that isn’t——”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>“What is it, Jack?” asked Billy quickly.</p>

<p>“Look at that chap there reading a paper. It’s
Donald Judson—Donald Judson, as sure as
you’re a foot high!”</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span><h2 id='t2978'>CHAPTER XVIII.—DONALD JUDSON AGAIN.</h2></div>

<p>Jack was right; the boy sitting in the reading
room was indeed the formerly ne’er-do-well son
of the man who had headed the plot to steal the
naval code, though what he could be doing in
Bomobori neither of the boys could guess. But
so changed was he in appearance from the flashily-dressed,
aggressively-conceited Donald Judson
they had known, that for a moment both boys
doubted the evidence of their eyes.</p>

<p>Donald had always, in the past, been inclined
to dudishness in his clothes. Now his clothing
was dilapidated and torn, his shoes were old
canvas ones that looked ready to fall apart, and
he had a scarecrow of a battered straw hat on
his head.</p>

<p>Moreover, his face was careworn and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
cheeks hollow and one eye appeared to have suffered
a blow of some sort for it was blackened
and swollen. Altogether he was a most woebegone
looking specimen of humanity, and the
boys wondered he was suffered about the hotel.
Donald’s presence there, however, was later accounted
for, although this, of course, the boys
did not know, by a long tale of disaster and suffering
he had sustained while gold hunting in
the interior. Donald said he was expecting remittances
from America and on this account had
been accommodated with quarters.</p>

<p>“My gracious, what a change,” exclaimed
Billy under his breath. “He looks like a regular
scarecrow.”</p>

<p>“He must have been in mighty tough luck,”
rejoined Jack. “But what beats me is what he
is doing here. It’s a very odd coincidence that
we should run into two of our old enemies on this
trip.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>“It is, indeed. But see, he is looking at us.
I suppose we ought to speak to the poor chap.”</p>

<p>Donald had dropped his paper and was staring
straight at the two lads as if they had been
ghosts. Then he got to his feet and came toward
them.</p>

<p>“Jack Ready!” he exclaimed, “where did you
come from?”</p>

<p>“We might ask the same question of you, Judson,”
said Jack, “but—er—you’ll excuse my saying
so, but you look as if you’d been in hard luck
lately.”</p>

<p>“I have been, oh I have been,” said Donald,
in a voice far different from his old bragging
one. “I got out of a job and shipped for a sailor.
I’d heard it was a fine life. The ship I was on
sailed away from Honolulu while I was still
ashore after overstopping my leave. Then I
got a job on a schooner that had a bad reputation,
when I was nearly starved, but I had to live
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
somehow. The captain of the <em>South Sea Lass</em>
was a brute. He——”</p>

<p>“Here, hold on,” cried Jack, seizing his arm
which was thin and bony, “was his name Broom——”</p>

<p>“Yes. ‘Bully’ Broom. He is little better
than a pirate. He treated me worse than a dog,
and finally, after blacking my eye, put me ashore
here several days ago. He——say, hold on,
what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Jack and Billy had seized him one on each
side and were dragging him across the floor of
the hotel office.</p>

<p>“There’s somebody here we want you to tell
your story to,” explained Jack. “It’ll be worth
something to you, but be sure to tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“As if I could lie, no matter what I said about
that wretch, ‘Bully’ Broom,” declared Donald.
“I’m sure he was mixed up in some illegal business.
Why we put into an island called the Pommer-Pommer——”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>“The Pamatous?” came from Billy.</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>“And some men were taken prisoners from a
schooner called the <em>Centurion</em>?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, but see here Ready, how in the world——?”</p>

<p>“Never mind that. What became of those
prisoners?”</p>

<p>“He locked them up in cabins. He said that
they were bad men and pearl robbers and that
he was bringing them to justice.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever talk with them?”</p>

<p>“No; except one, and I never got a chance to
say much to him. Broom watched me very
closely. He’d have murdered me if he’d thought
that I was trying to pry into his affairs.”</p>

<p>“What was the name of the man you talked
to?”</p>

<p>“He was a kind of a leader of the party, I
guess,” was the reply. “I used to take him his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
meals and there were precious few of those too,
for we were on short rations ourselves.”</p>

<p>“But his name—his name?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, Flukes—something like that, anyhow.
I never was good at names.”</p>

<p>“Was it Jukes?”</p>

<p>“That was it,” cried Donald, snapping his
fingers.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, what’s the matter?” demanded
the missing man’s brother as he finished with the
register and turned amazedly to face his two
young followers grasping Donald’s ragged figure
on each side as if they had a prisoner in custody.</p>

<p>“Mr. Jukes, this boy has seen and talked to
your brother within the last two weeks,” was the
announcement from Jack that sent the millionaire
staggering back against the hotel desk, for
once in his life giving way to uncontrolled amazement.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span><h2 id='t3128'>CHAPTER XIX.—HE TELLS A STRANGE STORY.</h2></div>

<p>“Bless my soul,” he exclaimed, when he found
breath, “you boys are always digging up somebody.
Who is this?”</p>

<p>He regarded the ragged figure of the unfortunate
Donald with some disapprobation. Jack
explained, and then Donald, stumbling and stuttering
somewhat under Mr. Jukes’ steady eye,
told his story.</p>

<p>“But you have not told us the most important
part of it all,” said the millionaire, as he concluded.
“Where was my unfortunate brother
taken to by this ruffian?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I don’t know, sir,” rejoined
the boy. “You see, they took good care I
shouldn’t know too much about their operations.
All I know is that I heard them saying something
about 'up the river.’”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>“Meaning this river—the Bomobori?” asked
Mr. Jukes.</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where the schooner is now?”
was the millionaire’s next question, but Donald
did not. All he knew was that, after landing him
in Bomobori, ‘Bully’ Broom had departed under
cover of night. Where he had headed for was
a mystery.</p>

<p>Jack whispered something to the millionaire
when Donald had concluded his narrative and
Mr. Jukes put his hand in his pocket and drew
out some coins. Then as he moved off Jack
rather hesitatingly said to Donald:</p>

<p>“You’ve had a hard time of it for money, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“Hard? That’s no name for it,” exclaimed
the other. “That rascal Broom never gave me
a cent, though when he shipped me he promised
me wages. If you hadn’t arrived I don’t know
what I should have done.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>“Well, we are willing to let bygones be bygones,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be fair to be rough on a fellow
who is down on his luck,” muttered Donald
rather grudgingly. “And—and I guess I’ve
learned a lesson, fellows.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Donald,” said Jack, handing the
boy the coins Mr. Jukes had given him, “here is
something from Mr. Jukes to help you along for
the present. I am sure he will see to it that you
do not suffer any more hardships in return for
the valuable information you have given us.”</p>

<p>The destitute lad’s face brightened wonderfully.
The money—about twenty dollars—was
more than he had seen in a long time. He
fingered the coins greedily.</p>

<p>“I—I’m much obliged to you and to your
friend, too,” he muttered rather shamefacedly,
“and—er—I’m sorry I ever played you mean
tricks.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that now,” said Jack,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
cutting him short. “My advice to you is not to hang
about here, but to get a job on the first ship
that touches here and go home.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go down to the shipping offices right now
and see what the chances are,” promised Donald,
and with a new spring in his step he started out
of the hotel.</p>

<p>“What a change,” exclaimed Jack, when he
had gone. “I never thought Donald Judson
could become so humbled.”</p>

<p>“He is certainly blue, and that is hardly surprising,”
agreed Billy. “But the question is
whether his seeming repentance is sincere.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope all that he has been through has
taught him a good lesson,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“It surely ought to have,” said Billy, and then
the subject was dismissed by a tall, half-clothed
native striding into the lobby and beating stridently
on a huge brass gong inscribed with queer
characters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>“What’s that for?” asked Jack of the clerk
behind the desk who looked like a German.</p>

<p>“Dot iss for Riz Tavel,” replied the clerk.</p>

<p>“For Riz who?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“For Riz Tavel,” rejoined the man impatiently,
as if surprised at their ignorance. “Riz
Tavel, dot means lunch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” replied Jack. “Well, I’m ready
for it whatever they call it.”</p>

<p>At the summons of the gong several guests
of the hotel came into the lobby, appearing as
if they had just got out of bed. The boys were
amazed to see that many of the male guests wore
pyjamas, while the women were in negligee. This,
however, applied only to the half castes and
Dutch residents. The Germans and English, who
did most of the trading at Bomobori, wore tropical
suits of conventional make.</p>

<p>They were waited on by barefooted Malays
who set before each of the boys and their shipmates,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
when these latter appeared, big soup
plates full of rice.</p>

<p>“They call this the 'riz-tavel,’ that means the
rice table,” explained Captain Sparhawk, thus
clearing away the secret of the mysterious words.
“Rice is a staple all through the East, just like
bread is at home.”</p>

<p>Having filled their plates with rice, as they
saw everybody else do, the Americans waited for
the next move. The waiters had all vanished
after depositing the rice, and Jack was moved
to remark whether that was all they were going
to get.</p>

<p>His question was answered by the re-appearance
of the barefooted servitors. They bore numerous
dishes piled with fish, duck, chicken, pork,
omelette, onions and peppers. The guests all
piled portions of every one of these dishes on the
top of the rice, and the visitors seeing that they
were not expected to ask for more plates were
fain to do the same. The boys, however, balked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
at a thin curried sauce which was supposed to be
poured over this hodge-podge of edibles.</p>

<p>Having disposed of what in itself was a
mighty meal they then found that they were
expected to despatch beefsteaks, salad and fruit.</p>

<p>“Well, they don’t starve you here, that’s one
thing sure,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“You must remember that their 'breakfast,’
as they call it, is eaten in the cool of the morning
and usually only consists of coffee and fruit,”
said Captain Sparhawk.</p>

<p>A groan from the dyspeptic Mr. Jukes, who
had eaten a hearty meal, was followed soon after
by the breaking up of the party. There was
much to be attended to, but Captain Sparhawk
said it would be useless to try to transact business
till the late afternoon when the sea breeze
sprung up. The interval between riz-tavel and
that hour he said was set aside for sleeping, and
nobody ever dreamed of interfering with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
custom. In fact, he would have found nobody to
transact business with.</p>

<p>He warned the boys against walking about in
the scorchingly hot afternoon sun also, as it was
said to induce fevers. There was nothing left
for them to do, therefore, but to pass the afternoon
in their rooms, although they would have
preferred exploring the town.</p>

<p>When they came down again they found Donald
Judson in the lobby. He appeared very disconsolate.
He said that no ships for American
ports would call at the port for a long time.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m stuck here for the rest of my
life,” he complained, and then made a sudden
suggestion.</p>

<p>“Say, why can’t you take me with you on that
expedition?” he asked, for the boys had told him
something about the object of their presence in
New Guinea.</p>

<p>“Um—er—I don’t know that Mr. Jukes
wants anybody else along,” hesitated Jack.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>“I’d work hard and do anything I was told
to,” said Donald pleadingly. “Won’t you ask
him about it? It’s awful to be stuck here like a
bump on a log.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps we might see about it,” relented
Jack, really feeling sorry for the unhappy
plight of their former enemy, mean and despicable
as he had proved himself to have been
in the past.</p>

<p>“Thanks, awfully,” exclaimed Donald, gratefully,
and he went off through the gardens, saying
that he was going to get himself a pair of
new shoes. Soon after Mr. Jukes, having got
over his attack of dyspepsia, appeared, the boys
laid Donald’s request before him.</p>

<p>“I really don’t know,” he hesitated. “Of
course, the lad is in hard luck, but somehow I
don’t exactly like his looks and I don’t see what
use he could be to us. I’d rather leave money
here to pay for his living till some ship arrives
he could get a berth on.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>“If you left him money in a place like this he
might fall back into his old bad ways,” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p>“That is true. I wouldn’t wish to push any
one down the hill when there was a chance of
helping them up,” said the millionaire, musingly.
“Well, I’ll see about it,” he added after an interval
of thought. Just then, as Captain Sparhawk
came up, the incident was ended and the two
elders set out for a trading store to arrange for
supplies and other necessaries for their dash into
the interior, for Mr. Jukes had resolved to act
on Donald Judson’s unexpected clue and make
his way up the river.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a notion that if we did take that
fellow Donald along that he would make trouble
for us,” said Raynor as soon as they were out
of ear-shot.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how he could, or what object he
would have,” doubted Jack. “Still, I myself
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
wouldn’t trust him very far, in spite of his declarations
of reform.”</p>

<p>But as it so happened neither of the boys need
have troubled themselves over the matter, for
that evening, when Mr. Jukes sent for Donald
to have a talk with him, the boy’s manner had
changed entirely. He was no longer servile and
cringing as he had been earlier. In fact, he
intimated very plainly that he wanted nothing
more to do with the Jukes party.</p>

<p>There was a reason for this, a reason that none
of the party naturally was able at the time to
guess. Donald’s change of front was not due
to any mere caprice. A deep-seated reason lay
behind it, and that reason was rooted in an encounter
he had had just after he left the boys
in the hotel garden.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span><h2 id='t3409'>CHAPTER XX.—A TRAITOR IN CAMP.</h2></div>

<p>Donald’s encounter had been with no less a
personage than ‘Bully’ Broom himself, whose
spies in the town had informed him that a party
of Americans had arrived on a yacht and had
been making inquiries about a missing man
named Jukes. Broom at once knew that the half-suspected
had happened, and that a strong party
in search of the missing man had, by some inexplicable
(to him) chance, arrived in Bomobori.</p>

<p>He perceived at once that Donald’s presence
at the hotel, where he had abandoned him to his
fate, might result disastrously for him and he
congratulated himself that the boy did not know
more of the fate of Jerushah Jukes than he had
already told our friends. But even that meager
information, Broom foresaw, might be used to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
great advantage, so he posted himself in a resort
frequented by men of his type of whom there
are many in the South Seas, and despatched some
of his crew to look for the boy he had cast off.</p>

<p>It was not long before Donald who, to do him
justice, came unwillingly at first, was presented
to Broom by two villainous-looking half-caste
Malay sailors, for Broom had few white men in
his crew.</p>

<p>“They talk too much,” he was wont to say.</p>

<p>As soon as Donald appeared, the ‘Bully’
reversed his usual tactics and tried to make himself
as pleasant as possible. He was a huge-framed
ruffian with a tangled black beard, and
burned brown enough by sun and wind to be
taken for a negro. Donald soon saw that he had
nothing to fear from Broom now, and being a
sharp boy he proceeded to take the initiative after
some verbal sparring.</p>

<p>“You’ve got an awful nerve sending for me
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
after the treatment you gave me,” he observed.
“What do you want, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Now see here, boy,” bellowed Broom, in his
gruff voice which he tried to render amiable
without much success, so used was he to ruling
his band with an iron hand, “I’ll admit that I
may have used you a bit roughly, but that was
the way of the sea. A fine young fellow like you,
though, oughtn’t to mind that. A little knocking
about is good for you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it was good for me to be left
stranded in this hole, too, I suppose,” said Donald.</p>

<p>“I didn’t leave you stranded. I was merely out
of funds and was coming back to pay you up and
get you out of trouble,” protested Broom, with
an earnestness that appeared genuine. “See
here.”</p>

<p>He plunged his hand into his pocket and drew
out a handful of gold and then let it fall trickling
on the table.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>“That doesn’t look as if I wasn’t able to do
it, either, does it?” he demanded. “Now, see
here,” he went on, “I’ve got a proposition to
make to you. You’re a smart lad, a clever lad,
and one that’s bound to get on the world. I’m
going to help you, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” demanded Donald,
who was very susceptible to flattery, and who
had a weak nature, easily played upon by any one
skillful enough to touch the right chord.</p>

<p>“That gang that arrived on the yacht? What
about them?” came from Broom.</p>

<p>“They are going to cook your hash if you don’t
look out,” said Donald. “That’s Jukes’ brother,
and they’re going to find him wherever you’ve
put him and then nab you.”</p>

<p>“So that’s the program, eh?” muttered the
‘Bully.’ “Now see here, Donald, I want you
on my side and I’m not afraid to pay for it. A
smart and clever boy like you could do me a deal
of harm if you were sided with the enemy. You’ll
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
be no loser by it. You haven’t told them anything
about our little deal with the <em>Centurion</em> yet, have
you?”</p>

<p>Donald did some quick thinking. He was
sharp enough to see that Broom was afraid of
what he might have said, for even in Bomobori
there was law and if it were known to Mr. Jukes
that Broom was in the vicinity it would be immediately
invoked. He balanced his two opportunities
against each other. Cupidity, greed for
money, had always been his main fault, and now
he thought he saw a way to make more out of
Broom than he could out of Mr. Jukes. Besides,
although he had appeared so humbled before the
boys, and ashamed of his past conduct, his hatred
still rankled, for the reason that he blamed all
his troubles on them and had often brooded over
plans of revenge.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t told them anything about the
<em>Centurion</em>,” he said at length, fearing that if he
told Broom how much the Jukes party knew
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
the freebooter might withdraw from any deal
he was about to make. “I simply gave them a
cock-and-bull story about myself when they were
astonished to find me here.”</p>

<p>“Ah! So you know them, then? They are
friends of yours?” exclaimed Broom.</p>

<p>“Hardly friends,” muttered Donald. “I knew
them in America.”</p>

<p>“You’ve no particular affection for them,
though?”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Your tone told me that, my young friend.”</p>

<p>“Well, I might as well admit it. I don’t like
them. They wronged me in America and that’s
why I am here now. I’ve treated them in a
friendly way because I’m out of money.”</p>

<p>Broom’s deep set eyes flashed.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a good head boy, very good,” he
said, approvingly. “Now to get down to business.
I’ll give you a handsome sum to stay on
my side.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>“Spot cash?”</p>

<p>“The money on the nail. I want you to do a
little job for me in return. Keep your mouth
absolutely shut, but find out all you can about
their plans. You will always find me here when
you want to report. Here’s something to start
with,” and he pushed over the gold which lay
on the table.</p>

<p>Donald’s eyes sparkled greedily as he counted
it.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll do what you say,” he remarked,
as he pocketed it, “but tell me one thing: Where
is Jerushah Jukes?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is for me to know and for them to
find out,” was Broom’s reply, “but I’ll tell you
all about it in proper time.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder you are not afraid to be seen
in the town,” said Donald. “Any one might
tell them about your being here.”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows about me but my friends, and
there is no danger of their talking.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>“But your schooner, which is as well known in
this part of the ocean as a mail steamer?”</p>

<p>Broom smiled.</p>

<p>“You don’t think I’d be fool enough to bring
my schooner in here after I heard about the
arrival of Jukes’ yacht?” he asked. “The <span class='it'>South
Sea Lass</span> is safely hidden up the coast. I came
here on a native canoe.”</p>

<p>“Well, you ought to be good at covering up
your tracks, you’ve had enough experience,” said
Donald, with a sort of grudging admiration for
the ruffian.</p>

<p>“One thing more,” said Broom, acknowledging
what he chose to take as a compliment with
a grin. “Jukes is very rich. Has he much money
with him this trip?”</p>

<p>“I guess not. Jukes is pretty foxy with his
money. If he has much it would be in some form
that is not negotiable. He is not the sort of man
to take chances.”</p>

<p>Broom nodded his massive head ponderously.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
He was evidently revolving some plan in his
mind. Presently he brought down his heavy
fist with a crash on the table.</p>

<p>“Jukes has poked his nose into this business,”
he exclaimed, “and it will cost him something
to get out of it before he gets through.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Donald.</p>

<p>“If he was made a prisoner for instance, he
would pay handsomely to be released.”</p>

<p>“I should say so. He’s worth about $20,000,000.”</p>

<p>Broom smacked his lips.</p>

<p>“Some of that’s as good as ours if you do what
I tell you,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Ours?” A greedy look crept into the boy’s
face.</p>

<p>“Yes, when he pays up you’ll get your share
and get even with the people you dislike at the
same time.”</p>

<p>When Donald left the place with one of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
ragged pockets bulging with unaccustomed
wealth, a compact had been formed that was to
cause our friends a great deal of trouble in the
near future.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span><h2 id='t3652'>CHAPTER XXI.—A MEMORABLE NIGHT.</h2></div>

<p>“It’s very peculiar that Donald should have
undergone such a sudden change of front,” said
Jack later that evening, following the boy’s
strange way of receiving Mr. Jukes’ proposal.
“He certainly appeared to want to go along the
worst way a few hours ago.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help thinking that he has been up to
some mischief,” replied Billy. “He’s got himself
a new outfit somewhere and I saw him paying
his hotel bill.”</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate that’s a laudable act,”
laughed Jack. “After all, we are not much concerned
with anything that he does now.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s true. By-the-way, how is that
wireless idea of yours for a portable set getting
along?”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>“First rate; I’ve got it all worked out on paper
and have cut the weight down to fifty pounds
without the aerials.”</p>

<p>“Good for you. I’ve got a notion we can make
a lot of use of it.”</p>

<p>“At any rate it won’t be much of an extra
load and it might get us out of a tight place, who
can tell?”</p>

<p>After some further talk the boys decided to
turn in, as they had to be up early the next
day. It was a hot, close night when the heavens
seemed to be pressed down like a brazen lid on
a pot. Far off, flashes of lightning illuminated
the distant sky toward the mountains where, for
all they knew, the millionaire’s abducted brother
might be concealed.</p>

<p>“Phew! It’s warm,” exclaimed Jack. “I guess
I’ll take a bath before I turn in.”</p>

<p>The boys’ bedroom was typical of hotels in
that part of the world. Its floor was bare except
for a strip of matting. There were two beds
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
in it, hung with mosquito netting curtains, and
a tiny wash basin and jug. An old-fashioned
bell-pull hung near one of the beds and Jack decided
to give it a tug and order a bath, when
one of the native “bell boys” appeared. After
a long interval, one of the barefooted functionaries
of the hotel arrived. Jack made his wants
known and the man hurried off again without a
word.</p>

<p>“That’s odd,” commented Jack, “but I guess
he’s gone to fill it and will be back directly to
say it’s ready.”</p>

<p>They waited for some time before a soft patter
of bare feet was heard in the hall and two of the
native servants entered carrying between them
a barrel. Another followed with a sort of dipper
made out of a cocoanut.</p>

<p>The boys stared in amazement as the men
advanced to the middle of the room and solemnly
set down the barrel and then stood about waiting
with an expectant look on their faces.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>“What in the world is all this?” demanded the
amazed Jack.</p>

<p>“Him your bath, boss,” came the answer, “you
gettee in him ballel, we washee you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be jiggered if you do,” exclaimed Jack.
“Get out of here,” and the men hurried off, first
staring at the boy as if they thought he was
mad. “Well, a New Guinea bath certainly accounts
for the appearance of some of the natives
I’ve seen about,” he laughed, as soon as they had
left. “But I suppose I must make the best of it.”</p>

<p>So Jack’s bath consisted of dipping water out
of the tub and pouring it over himself, trying not
to flood the room. But apparently he did so, for
soon a loud and indignant voice was heard at the
door.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” demanded the boys.</p>

<p>“Sapristi! Eet is I. Zee landlord. You flood
zee place. Zee water drip on me.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” sang out Jack, cheerfully, “but I’m
doing the best I can. You see, I’m not used to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
the customs of the country yet. I don’t understand
your way of bathing.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean zee bathing?”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to get a bath in this barrel that
you sent me up.”</p>

<p>“Taking a bath!” shouted the landlord in a
startled voice, “a bath at zees time of zee night.
You must be crazee. Anyhow, you drop no more
of zee water on me. I sleep zee room undaire.”</p>

<p>“Well, he doesn’t look as if a little water
would hurt him,” commented Billy, as the landlord’s
footsteps retreated down the passage.</p>

<p>The boys were soon in bed, but not to sleep.
Their exciting day amid new scenes had rendered
them wakeful and then, too, the beds of the Hotel
Bomobori were not couches of roses. The sheets
and pillows smelled abominably of camphor and
mildew, and the latter appeared to have been,
or so Billy declared, stuffed with corn cobs. The
same applied to the mattresses. But as if this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
was not enough, there came a sudden shrill cry
from somewhere in the room:</p>

<p>“Beck-ee! Beck-ee! Beck-ee!”</p>

<p>“What in the nation was that?” cried Billy,
considerably startled.</p>

<p>“Somebody calling for 'Becky,’” laughed
Jack, “but Rebecca won’t answer. Go to sleep,
Billy, if you can, on these miserable beds. It
must be some insect.”</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t anything venomous,” muttered
Raynor.</p>

<p>“Better keep your curtains close drawn and
then it can’t get at you, anyhow,” advised Jack.</p>

<p>“But then it shuts out all the air and I almost
suffocate,” complained Billy.</p>

<p>“Wow!” he yelled a moment later, in a tone
that roused Jack, who was almost asleep.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Billy?” he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Ugh, something soft with legs on it just ran
over my face,” cried Raynor. “For goodness’
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
sake get up and get a light. It may be something
that bites or stings.”</p>

<p>Jack lost no time in getting hurriedly out of
his bed, and as he shook the curtains something
was dislodged from them and went whirring and
banging round the room, blundering heavily
against the ceiling.</p>

<p>“What the dickens——!” exclaimed the boy,
considerably startled, when another cry from
Billy split the air.</p>

<p>“Ouch, for the love of Mike. A light, quick.
Something just nipped my toe.”</p>

<p>Jack fumbled for the matches; but, as is usual
in such cases, he located every object in the room
before he found them, finally colliding with the
washstand and sending it with a crash to the
ground floor. An instant later there was the
noise of slamming doors below and the landlord
came racing up the stairs to the boys’ room.</p>

<p>“Ciel! What is zee mattaire zees time? First
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
you try drown me, zen you make zee beeg crash
like zee tonnaire!”</p>

<p>“It’s all the fault of your old hotel,” exclaimed
Jack angrily, going to the door. “This
room is full of some kind of animals. It’s a regular
menagerie.”</p>

<p>He opened the door and the landlord, with a
curious-looking night-light, composed of a wick
floating in a tumbler full of some strong-smelling
oil that gave out a powerful odor of sandal wood,
came inside. Instantly there was a mighty scuffling
and several ugly looking lizards darted off
across the floor and a huge bat (no doubt the
creature that had vacated Jack’s bed-curtains
with such a prodigious flapping) went soaring
out through the open lattice-work doors which
led out on the verandah, but which the boys had
left open for coolness. There were also a dozen
other specimens of unclassified insects, both
winged and legged, which went scuttling off at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
the sight of the light. Then the landlord’s eye
fell on the open doors.</p>

<p>“Sacre!” he cried, “nevaire did I such a foolishness
see.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” demanded Jack.
“The only foolishness I can see is in our coming
to this hotel.”</p>

<p>The landlord shrugged his shoulders as if in
despair.</p>

<p>“What else do you expect but zee bat, zee scorpion,
zee centipede, zee leezard, zee chigre,
zee——”</p>

<p>“What makes a noise like 'becky, becky,
becky’?” asked Billy, breaking in on the catalogue.</p>

<p>“Ah! Zee biting leezard 'ee do zat.”</p>

<p>“Then that fellow that nipped my toe and the
one that sang out for Rebecca must be the same
individual,” cried Billy indignantly, “but go on
with your catalogue.”</p>

<p>The landlord looked puzzled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>“Zere was zee cat and zee dog 'ere, too?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“No, I said the catalogue. The list of insects
you were rattling off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I was going to say to you not to
leave zee porch doors open in zee night. And
also nevaire go to bed wizout lighting one of zees
lights.” He tapped the peculiar-smelling night-light
he held. “See, here eez one 'ere on zees
table.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t blame us for not knowing
what it was,” protested Jack, as he lighted it.
“I thought it was some peculiar kind of drink.
It’s the first time I ever saw light served in a
tumbler.”</p>

<p>“Zee light veree good,” said the landlord, as
he was leaving the room. “Zee animal no like
zee light, also they no like zee smell.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame them,” said Jack, after the man
had left, and the odd tumbler lamp was burning
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
with a sputtering, smoking flame, “especially
the smell part.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, anything is better than sharing
your bed with you-don’t-know-what creepy-crawly
things,” declared Raynor.</p>

<p>“Yes, and lizards that go round hollering girls’
names,” agreed Jack. “I fancy we’ll sleep better
now. But, after all, we’ve got to get used to it
all for we may meet worse in the jungle.”</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span><h2 id='t3930'>CHAPTER XXII.—INTO THE JUNGLE.</h2></div>

<p>The next day was busily spent by the boys.
Jack had his portable wireless to assemble. Raynor
was assigned as “chief of baggage,” and Captain
Sparhawk and Mr. Jukes, with Muldoon,
who spoke the Papuan dialect after a fashion,
occupied the time rounding up the native bearers
and finding a suitable “head man.” The latter
was very important to the success of the expedition,
both to keep the other natives up to their
work and to find trails and, if necessary, act as
interpreter. Through the good offices of Jabez
Hook, a “smart Yankee” who ran a “general
store” at Bomobori, and was a warm friend of
Captain Sparhawk’s, they finally found just the
man they wanted. He was a tall, up-right Papuan
with an exceptionally intelligent face, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
spoke fair English, knew the country thoroughly
and appeared about thirty years old. Salloo, as
he called himself, agreed to have everything in
readiness for a start into the interior by the next
morning. He held out hopes that from some of
the interior tribes they would get news of the lost
ones, for among the natives news travels fast,
and if ‘Bully’ Broom had conveyed prisoners into
the inland some of the tribesmen would be sure
to know about it.</p>

<p>When Jack returned from the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>,
where he had set up his apparatus, he reported
that all was well on board and everything going
forward smoothly under the command of the
first officer. Thurman appeared to be delighted
with his chance to vindicate himself, but acting
under Mr. Jukes’ advice, it had been deemed
prudent to refuse him shore liberty till the party
returned. Thurman did not seem to resent this,
and told Jack that after all he had gone through,
a “soft berth” and good meals on the yacht
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
appealed to him. He had seen enough of the
tropics, so he declared, to have no especial desire
to go ashore at Bomobori.</p>

<p>It was not till eleven o’clock that night that
they turned in. But when they did so it was
with a satisfied feeling that every detail had been
attended to. Not the least satisfactory result
of the day had been Jack’s achievement of perfecting
the portable wireless which would keep
them at all times in touch with the yacht.</p>

<p>The next morning dawned bright and clear.
The boys were up before any of the rest of the
party, dressed in khaki suits, sun helmets and
stout leggings, for much of the way would lie
through ragged bush. Each lad carried a water
canteen, a pocket filter, compass, knife, and wore
a service revolver attached to a cartridge belt.
In these “uniforms” they looked very business-like,
and capable of giving a good account of
themselves in any emergency. Soon after the
other members of the party appeared somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
similarly attired. Mr. Jukes’ pockets bulged with
boxes of dyspepsia pills, and Muldoon wore his
sailor uniform with the addition of leggings and
a sun helmet.</p>

<p>“Shure I look like a sea soldier no liss,” was the
way he summed up his appearance, and the boys
couldn’t help agreeing with him.</p>

<p>While they were at breakfast, Salloo and his
“bearers” presented themselves.</p>

<p>Salloo greeted them with a low “salaam,” and
volunteered the information that:</p>

<p>“Him welly good day for makum start. Go
many miles. Good trail for first part of journey.”</p>

<p>“Well, the further we go, the quicker we’ll get
back,” commented Muldoon in true Irish style.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock they were off. Nobody in the
town knew the true object of their expedition, but
supposed they were off on a hunt for entomological
specimens, for New Guinea swarms with rare
forms of insect life and many intrepid collectors
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
have found it a happy hunting ground, some of
them paying for their devotion to science with
their lives.</p>

<p>At first the question of traveling on horse-back
had been mooted. But Salloo promptly vetoed
this. The country was too rough and thickly
grown to make horse-back travel feasible for
more than a few miles, he declared. They might
have used the river, but it was only navigable
for a short distance when the swift current and
the shoals made it dangerous for up-stream
travel. Natives coming down it always abandoned
their dugouts, which were simply hollow
trees, at Bomobori, and went back to their villages
on foot.</p>

<p>The town was soon left behind and they struck
into a trail which was broad and well trodden.
On all sides were dense groves of tropical vegetation,
towering palms, spreading mangoes laden
with golden fruit, that ever-present banana and
fragrant guava and lemon trees. From the tall
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
lance-wood and cotton trees great creepers and
lianas, looking like serpents, twined and coiled.
There was a moist, steaming heat in the air.</p>

<p>“It’s just like being in a big conservatory at
home,” said Jack, and indeed the air had just the
odor and closeness of a glass-house.</p>

<p>“This is fever territory,” declared Mr. Jukes,
administering a large dose of quinine to himself.
“There is to be no sleeping on the ground, remember.”</p>

<p>“I guess not, after the experience we had in
our room at the hotel last night,” said Raynor,
and amidst much laughter he narrated the details
of their uncomfortable night.</p>

<p>As they pushed onward, there came from the
river, which glinted like molten lead in the sunshine
at their left, a long-drawn cry which startled
all the white members of the expedition. It resembled
the human voice and appeared to be the
appeal of someone in agony.</p>

<p>“Shure there’s some poor soul in throuble over
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
yonder forninst the river,” declared Muldoon,
and before any one could stop him he had left the
trail and was making for the water.</p>

<p>“Hi you white man, you comee back,” cried
Salloo.</p>

<p>But he was too late. Hardly had Muldoon left
the trail than he sank up to his knees in black,
oozy mud which held him like liquid glue.</p>

<p>His struggles only made matters worse, and
soon he was up to his knees in the evil-smelling,
glutinous mass which bubbled about him as it
sucked him down.</p>

<p>“Help! Murther! Shure, O’im kilt intirely!”
cried the frightened man, waving his arms frantically.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span><h2 id='t4092'>CHAPTER XXIII.—A DANGEROUS TREE.</h2></div>

<p>All this time, from the river, came the same
weird cries that had mystified them. What with
these cries and Muldoon’s lusty yells for help,
had there been an enemy within a mile they must
have heard them, but luckily they were in a territory
known to be peaceable, although Salloo was
not quite so sure of some of the tribes who had
a bad reputation as “head hunters.”</p>

<p>“He’s stuck in the mud!” exclaimed Jack, and
was starting forward to Muldoon’s assistance
when Salloo grabbed his arm.</p>

<p>“No go,” he warned, “him mud velly bad.
Make drown in mud plitty quick no get helpee.”</p>

<p>The native began making his way by a circuitous
route toward the luckless Muldoon. In
his hand he had a long rope. He leaped from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
tuft to tuft of the hummocks that appeared above
the black soil. As soon as he got close enough to
Muldoon he threw the struggling boatswain the
end of the line, which Muldoon had presence of
mind enough to place under his arm-pits. Then
Salloo skipped nimbly back to the trail and all
laying hold with a will they soon hauled Muldoon
out of his disagreeable predicament, although he
was a sorry sight to look at.</p>

<p>“But faith,” he exclaimed, “it’s glad enough I
am to know O’im not dead intirely. A little mud
will soon dry and clean off, begob.”</p>

<p>“Tropical places are full of just such treacherous
swamps,” declared Captain Sparhawk. “It
will be well for all of us to be very careful and
not leave the trail except by Salloo’s advice.”</p>

<p>But now the strange wailing sound which they
had for the moment forgotten in the excitement
of Muldoon’s rescue again startled them. The
cause of it was quickly explained by Salloo.</p>

<p>“Him <em>dugong</em>, allee samee sea-cow,” he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>“Oh, I know now—like the manitou they have
in Florida,” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“Me no know 'bout man or two,” said Salloo,
“but him big an’mul. Live in river. Makee noise
like heap cryee allee timee.”</p>

<p>“It sounds as if somebody was being murdered,”
commented Raynor. “However, I guess
we’re not the first people to be scared by the dinner-gong,
or whatever you call it.”</p>

<p>The halt for the noon-day meal was made in a
pleasant grove of tropical trees which stood on
safe rising ground to one side of the trail. All
the white members of the party were glad enough
of the chance to take a rest, but the wiry natives
appeared to be perfectly fresh and strong as when
they set out, despite their heavy burdens. While
the natives began cooking their rice and salted
fish, with a sort of curry sauce, Salloo set about
making a fire for the whites. With marvelous
dexterity he twirled a stick between his outspread
hands against some dry tinder and soon had a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
good blaze going. The boys scattered to get
wood, of which they soon had a sufficient quantity.
Then, determined to make the most of their
halt, they flung themselves down under a
peculiarly fine tree with wide, dark green leaves,
glossy as polished leather.</p>

<p>They were chatting about the incidents of the
trip so far when Jack all at once felt something
strike him on the arm. His first impression was
that it was a stone. But on looking at the place
where he had been struck he saw that the sleeve
of his shirt, for he had laid aside his khaki coat,
had been ripped in parallel lines as if a curry comb,
with sharp teeth, had been drawn down
it. He felt a sharp pain moreover, and then he
saw blood on his arm.</p>

<p>Billy had sprung up in alarm at his sharp
exclamation of pain, and was peering into the
brush in the dread of seeing savage faces peering
at them. His shout of alarm brought them
all, including Salloo, on the run to Jack’s side.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
The boy explained what had occurred and the
faces of the whites grew grave. If they were
attacked at this early stage of the journey it
augured ill for the remainder of their adventure.</p>

<p>But Salloo speedily solved the mystery. Lying
on the ground beside Jack was a green, oval-shaped
ball, about the size of those projectiles
that one sees stacked by memorial cannons in
our country. But this missile was covered with
sharp spikes like the spines of a hedgehog. Salloo
pointed up into the beautiful tree under which
they had cast themselves down to rest.</p>

<p>“Nobody throw him,” he explained, “him big
fruit, some callum Durion nut. You comee way
from there. One hittee you headee your blains
getee knocked out.”</p>

<p>“They deserve to be for getting up a scare like
that,” laughed Jack, who, like Billy, stepped
hastily from under the dangerous tree. “It seems
to be a pretty good idea in this country to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
always on the look out. Even nature seems to
have it in for you.”</p>

<p>Jack’s arm was doctored by Captain Sparhawk,
for it was quite painful, but luckily the spines of
the durion, sometimes called the Jack fruit, are
not poisonous and it was soon all right again.
But during the noon-day meal, which was then
ready, when they heard the crashing of nut after
nut from the durion tree, both boys felt they had
had a very lucky escape from having their skulls
fractured.</p>

<p>“Be jabers,” commented Muldoon, “shure o’ive
been in a hurricane where the blocks and tackle
that was ripped from aloft made yez skip around
loively to dodge thim, but this is the first toime
thot iver I heard of a three throwing things at
yez as if ye was a nigger dodger at a fair.”</p>

<p>“You’ll discover stranger things than that,
Muldoon, before we have been very long in New
Guinea,” said Captain Sparhawk.</p>

<p>“Faith, so long as they’re not snakes, oi dunno
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
thot I care much,” said the Irishman. “Begob,
o’im thinking that St. Pathrick would be a good
man to have along in a counthry where the craturs
are. Wun wave uv his sthick and away
they’d all go, bad luck to thim.”</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span><h2 id='t4246'>CHAPTER XXIV.—WIRELESS AT WORK.</h2></div>

<p>For two days they traveled thus, making fresh
discoveries constantly. Once, for instance, Billy
triumphantly pounced on what seemed like a fine
bit of fire-wood for the noon-day halt. But he
dropped it with a yell, as the “stick” suddenly developed
legs and on being dropped walked off.</p>

<p>“Begorrah, there’s a shillalegh come to loife,
so it has,” yelled Muldoon, as he observed the
phenomenon; but the “shillalegh” was only one
of those strange “stick insects” that abound in
that part of the world and sometimes fool even
the natives.</p>

<p>At noon of the third day they found themselves
approaching a settlement, as cleared ground,
where grew maize, sugar cane, yams and other
plants, testified. The village proved to be a large
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span>
one where white traders and animal collectors
often stopped and there was a native hostelry in
it conducted by a greasy-looking Frenchman who
had a native wife as dirty-looking as he was.
The native huts were all of bamboo hung with
cocoanut mats. Natives squatted in front of
them chewing betel nuts, the juice crimsoning
their lips and chins. All ages and both sexes indulged
in the habit, which is universal throughout
Polynesia and the South Seas generally.</p>

<p>There appeared to be a lot of rivalry among the
men as to who could grow the fuzziest, most outstanding
crop of hair.</p>

<p>“Faith, a barber would starve to death in this
country,” declared Muldoon.</p>

<p>Just then a young woman came down the
“street,” if such the muddy track between the
huts could be called. She held something in her
arms that they thought at first was a baby. But
it turned out to be a young pig!</p>

<p>“We’ll rest at the hotel here,” said Mr. Jukes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
“till it grows cooler. My dyspepsia is bad again.
It comes from traveling during the heat of the
day as we have been doing.”</p>

<p>The mid-day meal was cooked on a sort of
altar built of stones. The boys watched the operations
in this open-air kitchen with interest.
At least twenty natives assisted in the culinary
demonstration and the chatter and laughter was
deafening. They made a hearty meal on the
native fare, which they were astonished to find
was quite as good as anything they had tasted
at home.</p>

<p>As Mr. Jukes did not wish to go forward at
once after the meal they took it easy in several
grass hammocks stretched under a large, shady,
tree. The fact that the natives kept coming up
and peering into their faces and that babies,
chickens and pigs wandered about under the hammocks
did not disturb the boys after a while, and
they dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder the natives here are lazy,”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
remarked Jack, when Muldoon awakened him
with a yell of “All hands on deck to see it rain.”
“I rarely slept in the day-time, but here I just
dozed off without knowing it.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” chimed in Raynor. “I didn’t
have to even half try.”</p>

<p>“This climate is very enervating, boys,” declared
Captain Sparhawk, joining in the conversation.
“That is why this part of the globe
makes so little progress toward civilisation. Men
who are hustlers in their own country come here
determined to make the dirt fly, but after a few
months their energy oozes out of them like—well,
say like tar out of the seams of a hot ship’s
deck.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good comparison,” laughed Jack.</p>

<p>Once more everything was stirring in the adventurers’
camp, and soon they were on their way
again. The Frenchman, whose “hotel” they had
left, had told them that by evening they would
reach another village, the last one they would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
encounter before plunging into the really wild
jungle, where there was another “hotel.”</p>

<p>“As it will be our last chance for many days
to sleep under a roof, I propose we stay there to-night,”
said Mr. Jukes, swallowing a pill.</p>

<p>This suited the rest of the party and they
struck forward at a brisk pace after their refreshing
rest and sleep. The jungle was filled
with countless birds, but there were no feathered
songsters among them. The air was filled with
nothing but discordant shrieks and cries that set
the teeth on edge. Once the boys had the thrill
of seeing a bird of paradise, with its glorious
plumage and wonderful tail feathers, flash across
their path.</p>

<p>The village they stopped at that evening resembled
in almost every respect the one in which
the noon-day halt had been made. There were
the same huts, the same swarming pigs and chickens,
and the same fuzzy-headed Papuans, many
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
of them returning from the fields with corn and
yams.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the “hotel,” which had no
more pretensions to the name than the other
hostelry, proved to be a Portuguese half-caste,
lacking one eye, and sporting a pair of huge brass
ear-rings. His wife was a giant negress. However,
they welcomed the party warmly, as they
had good reason to do, not having had any guests
for some time, and pigs and fowls were at once
killed for supper, everything in such places being
ordered “on the hoof,” so to speak. Mr. Jukes
delighted his native followers by ordering an
elaborate meal for them also, in celebration of
the fact that on the morrow they would leave
“civilization” behind them.</p>

<p>Jack, at Mr. Jukes’ request, set up his wireless
plant, stringing the aerials from a tall tree up
which one of the natives swarmed like a monkey
to make the long wires fast. As he worked, he
and Billy talked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span>“I guess we’ll sleep with one eye open to-night,”
said Jack in an undertone, for they were surrounded
by a curious crowd watching the white
boy “make conjure medicine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, those hotel people are a crafty-looking
couple,” rejoined Billy, “and in a country like this
it’s a good thing to regard everybody with suspicion
till you find them all right.”</p>

<p>Muldoon sauntered up to them as they chatted
and worked and had his word to put in too.</p>

<p>“Begorrah, that Portugee don’t look like no
angel,” he said, “and his wife looks like the ould
Nick himsilf.”</p>

<p>“Just what we were talking about, Muldoon,”
said Jack. “It will be a good thing if we keep our
eyes and ears open.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a href='images/i04f.jpg'><img src='images/i04.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0003' style='width:400px;height:528px;' /></a>
<p class='caption'>It was some time before Jack got a reply, but at last he received Thurman’s answering call.</p>
</div>

<p>At last Jack got everything ready, and Raynor
started to turn the hand-crank of the generator,
for of course a gasoline engine for that purpose
could not be carried into the jungle. When the
storage batteries were charged, Jack began to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
pump out the <em>Sea Gypsy’s</em> call. At the first
crackle and whip-snap like explosion of the spark
the natives scattered with yells. Even Salloo,
who was looking on, and had to stand his ground
to maintain his dignity before his men, looked
uneasy and shifted about nervously.</p>

<p>It was some time before Jack got a reply, but
at last he received Thurman’s answering call.</p>

<p>Everything it seemed was O. K. and there was
no particular news from his end except that
another party had started up-country right on
the heels of Mr. Jukes’ expedition. It was
thought they were traders, Thurman said. Jack
gave his news and then flashed “Good-night.”</p>

<p>He told Mr. Jukes of the conversation and of
the start of a second party.</p>

<p>“I heard nothing in Bomobori of a second expedition,”
mused Mr. Jukes, on receipt of this
information. “But no doubt they are traders. It
seems odd, though, that they didn’t join with us
if they were coming this way, as is the general
custom.”</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span><h2 id='t4451'>CHAPTER XXV.—A JUNGLE HOTEL.</h2></div>

<p>The hostelry was divided into half a dozen
rooms walled with bamboo, and all on the ground
floor. Rough mats of cocoanut cloth alone interposed
between the sleepers and the ground, and
cockroaches and singing lizards abounded. But
by this time the lads had become pretty well used
to the night noises of the jungle, which are far
more tumultuous after dark than in the day-time,
and as for the hard beds, they were too tired to
mind much where they slept.</p>

<p>Jack had not slept long when he was awakened
by someone calling to him. It was Muldoon. The
Irishman was plainly agitated by some excitement
as he stood in the grass-curtained door-way.</p>

<p>“Whist!” he exclaimed, holding a finger to his
lips, “is thot you Misther Riddy?”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>“Yes, what’s the trouble, Muldoon?”</p>

<p>“Shure o’ive made a discovery, sor.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Thot other party. Ther ones you was tiligraphing
about.”</p>

<p>“Well, what about them?”</p>

<p>“They’re here, begob.”</p>

<p>“Where, in the hotel?”</p>

<p>“No, in the woods back of the house.”</p>

<p>“Camping there?”</p>

<p>“No, bejabbers. There’s something looks
queer to me about the whole thing, that’s why I
called yez. They’ve sent for the Dago that runs
this shabeen, sor.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they want to get accommodations?”</p>

<p>“Thin why wouldn’t they stip up like min and
ask for ’em?” was Muldoon’s unanswerable retort.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Jukes, rubbing his eyes sleepily,
appeared in the door-way. Behind him stood
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
the giant negress. The millionaire had evidently
dressed hastily.</p>

<p>“I’ve got news, Ready,” he exclaimed in a
rather excited voice. “This woman has just told
me that her husband wants to see me outside. I
gathered it’s on some matter connected with my
brother.”</p>

<p>“Yassir,” grinned the hideous negress, showing
a double row of sharply filed teeth, “dat’s it, sah.
It’s 'bout yo’ brudder.”</p>

<p>Raynor had awakened by this time and was
sitting up on his mat listening sleepily. He eyed
the woman narrowly as she spoke and an uneasy
conviction entered his mind that all was
not well.</p>

<p>“You’d better be cautious, sir,” warned Jack,
who also felt an undeniable feeling of suspicion,
“something may be wrong.”</p>

<p>“What can be wrong,” demanded Mr. Jukes,
rather impatiently. “I’m going outside to see.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
If it’s about my brother it’s my duty to do so
at once.”</p>

<p>“Then if you’re going I’ll go with you,” said
Jack, hastily throwing on the garments he had
divested himself of, and strapping on his revolver.</p>

<p>“And begorrah o’i second the motion,” declared
Muldoon.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment for me,” begged Billy.</p>

<p>“No, stay here,” said Jack. “If anything goes
wrong, I’ll fire three shots.”</p>

<p>A minute later, followed by the native woman,
the three left the place. As they reached the door
she took the lead and conducted them through a
bamboo grove to a thick growth of trees under
which her husband and a big man with black
beard were conversing.</p>

<p>“You wish to see me?” asked Mr. Jukes, addressing
the bearded one.</p>

<p>“Yes; zees gentleman say zat 'e ave good news
for you,” said the landlord, spreading his hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>“Begorrah, oi don’t see no gintilmin here excipt
oursilves,” muttered Muldoon.</p>

<p>“Muldoon, be quiet,” ordered Mr. Jukes, then
turning to the black-bearded man he went on
with, “Well, sir, what is it you wish?”</p>

<p>“You are Mr. Jukes?” asked the other, in a
deep, gruff voice.</p>

<p>“I am, what of it?”</p>

<p>“I want to see you. I have news for you.”</p>

<p>“But—but I don’t know you. Why didn’t you
come to the hotel if you had anything to say to
me?” asked the millionaire in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>“I wanted to talk to you in private about your
brother,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“My brother! Why, we are searching for him
now. That is the reason of our presence in the
jungle. Do you know anything about him?”</p>

<p>“I do. It was he who sent me here.”</p>

<p>“Jerushah sent you?” the millionaire was fairly
amazed now. “He is then alive?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he is a prisoner and very sick.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
Through natives he heard of the arrival of your
expedition and sent me even at this hour to bring
you to him.”</p>

<p>“That is a strange story, my man,” said Mr.
Jukes suspiciously. “I might say it is almost
incredible.”</p>

<p>“I’ll admit it does sound strange,” said the
other, “but strange things happen in this part
of the world. I might add that the other Mr.
Jukes wants to see you alone. Something about
a pearl, I believe.”</p>

<p>Jack gave a tug at Mr. Jukes’ sleeve. The lad
had been peering about him through the dark
trees and had seen something the others had not.
If his eyes had not deceived him, and Jack did
not believe they had, several forms were moving
about in the gloom beneath the interlaced
branches.</p>

<p>“Mr. Jukes,” he whispered, “I don’t believe this
man. I think we are in some sort of a trap.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>192</a></span>
Why didn’t he come to the house with this cock-and-bull
story?”</p>

<p>Mr. Jukes hesitated. It was strange that this
man of great affairs, before whom board meetings
quailed, and who ruled almost supreme
among the great money kings of New York, appeared
to be lost now that he was out of his little
world and among the great elemental things of
the untraveled jungle.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know, Ready,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Ask him,” suggested Jack, with his hand on
his revolver. He felt that a crisis of some sort
was at hand, but it was too late to retreat now.</p>

<p>Mr. Jukes, with some of his old pomposity, put
the question. The bearded man’s reply was brief
and to the point.</p>

<p>“That is beside the question,” he snapped.
“Are you coming with me?”</p>

<p>Before any reply could be made the bearded
man’s eye caught the glint of Jack’s weapon.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span>
Instantly a shrill whistle sounded. From the trees
leaped a dozen or more men.</p>

<p>“Howly saints! A trap!” yelled Muldoon.</p>

<p>“A trap!” echoed Jack. He raised his pistol
to cover the black-bearded man. But before he
had it leveled both he and Mr. Jukes were thrown
from their feet by a combined attack and in a
twinkling both the millionaire and the boy were
helpless.</p>

<p>“Run for the house, Muldoon. Warn the others.
Come after us as quick as you can.”</p>

<p>“Hold your horses there,” roared the black-bearded
man, who, as our readers will have
guessed, was ‘Bully’ Broom himself, with his
band of renegade followers. He tried to block
the boatswain’s path as Muldoon darted off.</p>

<p>Biff, the old seaman’s knotted fist shot out and
caught the redoubtable ‘Bully’ between his eyes.
He staggered but did not fall.</p>

<p>“Take that, you murtherin’ spalpeen,” shouted
Muldoon, as he darted off among the trees and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
was speedily lost to sight. Three or four of the
band pursued him, but ‘Bully’ Broom called them
back.</p>

<p>“We’ve got the fellows we want,” he said;
“bind and gag them and if they show fight don’t
be too gentle with them.”</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span><h2 id='t4680'>CHAPTER XXVI.—PRISONERS OF ‘BULLY’ BROOM.</h2></div>

<p>Jack fought desperately, but as he was helpless,
and in return for his struggles received only
a rain of brutal blows, he deemed it wiser to remain
quiet. Soon both he and the millionaire had
their hands tied behind their backs and gags of
dirty grass were thrust, none too gently, into
their mouths.</p>

<p>“Now march, and behave yourselves or you’ll
be shot,” snarled ‘Bully’ Broom, whose temper
had not been improved by the blow Muldoon’s
strong fist had given him.</p>

<p>As it would have been folly to have resisted,
situated as they were, the two prisoners did as
they were told. Jack wondered where they were
being taken and why they had been attacked.
Even his acute mind did not connect their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
captors with ‘Bully’ Broom and his gang. The
boy thought they had fallen into the hands of
one of those bands of free-booters, known to frequent
parts of the bush, holding up helpless travelers.</p>

<p>He felt sorry for Mr. Jukes, though. The millionaire
was stout and accustomed to his ease.
After his tiring day this night march must have
been cruel exertion to him. But if he lagged, the
man of millions received a vicious jab in the back
with the stock of a rifle.</p>

<p>Even in this trouble, Jack could not help reflecting
on the strange turn of the wheel of fortune
that had brought Jacob Jukes, man of millions,
into the heart of a lonely jungle, a shirt-sleeved,
perspiring prisoner, in the hands of a band of
men of undoubtedly desperate character. He
wondered, too, if the millionaire himself was not
contrasting this cruel march through the forest
with his magnificent town and country houses,
his automobiles, his lavishly furnished offices and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
his elaborate entertainments. If he were doing
so, Jack surmised that his thoughts must be bitter.
In thinking thus, Jack contrived largely to
keep his mind off his own misfortunes.</p>

<p>A journey of some hours, at the close of which
Mr. Jukes began to give every outward sign of
deep physical exhaustion, brought them to a
clearing, once cultivated, but now neglected, overlooking
the river. Here, on a bluff about fifty
feet above the water, in years gone by, a trading
company had maintained a post. It had been
built in the days when the natives were troublesome
in that section and it was a strong structure
like a fort. It was almost overgrown with
rank tropical vines, but evidently the way to it
was not unknown to the men conducting Mr.
Jukes and Jack.</p>

<p>Lanterns were lit and when the two captives
had been ushered in both were made fast to the
logs that formed the walls of the place. Jack
glanced at Mr. Jukes. The millionaire was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
assuredly a pitiable-looking object. His fine white
shirt was torn almost to ribbons by thorny vines
encountered along the path, his carefully
groomed appearance had given way to a general
disreputableness that would have gained him
recognition by any tramp as a member of the
fraternity, his face was almost purple, from his
enforced exertions and the gag in his mouth.</p>

<p>“Gracious, he looks as if he might have apoplexy
at any minute,” thought Jack, who, although
he was in as bad a plight, characteristically
did not spend any sympathy on himself.
Perhaps the members of the band that had captured
them noticed what Jack had, and feared
fatal consequences, for Mr. Jukes’ gag was soon
removed and so was Jack’s.</p>

<p>When this had been done, and before Mr. Jukes
could recover his breath enough to speak, the
rascals withdrew to the other end of the building,
which was like a long mess hall and may
indeed have been used at some time as such.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>“What does this outrage mean?” demanded
Jack, as the black-bearded man strolled off last of
all, after looking them over with a cynical smile.</p>

<p>“You would like to know, eh, Jack Ready?”</p>

<p>“So you know my name?” exclaimed Jack in
some surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, and that of your companions who will
join you here before long. We hope to have the
pleasure of your company for quite a long time.”</p>

<p>“You abominable ruffian,” cried Jack, overcome
by indignation, “you will pay dearly for this some
time,” but at the same time the boy did not believe
that the rest had been caught napping and
captured. They were a strong party and, led by
Muldoon, he knew they would put up a stiff fight.</p>

<p>“I wish you had taken my warning, Mr. Jukes,”
Jack could not help saying, as soon as they were
left alone.</p>

<p>“You wish it no more fervently than I do, my
boy,” was the despondent reply. “Wall Street
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>
and New York seem like a dream to me. Only
this horror is real.”</p>

<p>“I would like to know what it all means,” said
Jack. “These men can’t be just common robbers;
they appear to have a regular hang-out here.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help thinking that I’ve seen some of
these ruffians loitering about Bomobori,” said
Mr. Jukes.</p>

<p>“That struck me, too. At any rate they must
be the party Thurman wirelessed to me about as
leaving just behind us. They’ve followed our
trail pretty closely, too. We should have been
more on our guard.”</p>

<p>Slowly the hours wore by till daylight began
to show in the narrow windows of the old barracks.
The positions of both prisoners were
most uncomfortable. The strain on their arms
from the tightly tied cords was almost unbearable.</p>

<p>“And to think I used to complain of discomfort
if my chauffeur allowed my car to bump over a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>201</a></span>
rut,” groaned Mr. Jukes, with a comical pathos
that would have made Jack smile had they been
in any other situation.</p>

<p>All the men had left the place, but they could
hear the murmur of their voices outside. A smell
of wood smoke drifted in and then the tantalising
odors of frying bacon and the aroma of coffee
combined to remind both prisoners that, in spite
of their sufferings, they were both hungry and
thirsty.</p>

<p>“I wonder if we are going to get any breakfast?”
asked Jack, after a silence broken only
by Mr. Jukes’ pathetic groans.</p>

<p>“I’d risk a month of dyspepsia for a plate of
beans and bacon right now,” wailed the unhappy
millionaire.</p>

<p>“Yes,” thought Jack. “There are decidedly
situations where all the millions in the world
wouldn’t do you much good, and this, apparently,
is one of them.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>At last footsteps were heard approaching from
the opposite end of the ramshackle building.</p>

<p>“Somebody at last,” cried Jack.</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken when ‘Bully’ Broom
stood before them, followed by—Donald Judson.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span><h2 id='t4860'>CHAPTER XXVII.—AT THE OLD FORT.</h2></div>

<p>Jack found it difficult to credit his eyesight as
he gazed at the boy who formerly had made so
much trouble for them and the gigantic ruffian
who stood beside him.</p>

<p>“Judson! Is it possible?” he gasped. “What
brought you here?”</p>

<p>“Are you a prisoner, too?” demanded Mr.
Jukes.</p>

<p>“A prisoner?” laughed Judson. “Well, that’s
a good one, I must say. Only fools walk into
traps.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you doing here then, boy?”
demanded the millionaire, recollecting his former
kindness to Donald. “You ask him, Ready. He’s
a friend of yours.”</p>

<p>“He’s no friend of mine, Mr. Jukes,” denied
Jack. “Can’t you see it all?”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span>“See what?”</p>

<p>“Why, the contemptible turn-coat is in with
these rascals.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>“So, Judson,” went on Jack, “this is how you
repay our kindness to you?”</p>

<p>“Your kindness,” sneered the boy. “I want
none of it. I’m in with a good crowd now. Besides,
I told you in Bomobori I didn’t want to
go with your old expedition.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t refuse the money I got you
from Mr. Jukes,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s made of money,” chuckled Donald,
“and we mean to get some more of it.”</p>

<p>“You miserable young whelp,” panted the
helpless millionaire, purple with rage, “if I had
you in America——”</p>

<p>“And anyhow,” continued Judson, thoroughly
enjoying this, “you are only getting what’s coming
to you, Ready. In the States you tried to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
have me put in pris—er that is you wanted to
tell lies about me.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry we didn’t have you locked up, now,”
said Jack bitterly. “I suppose you put this gang
of scoundrels on our trail.”</p>

<p>“You can suppose anything you want,” was
the rejoinder, but a bit of the old boastfulness
crept into his tone, “and you’re going to pay up,
too, before you get out of this. Have you had
them searched, Captain Broom?”</p>

<p>“What——?” shouted the millionaire, almost
beside himself at this sudden revelation of the
black-bearded man’s identity, “are you ‘Bully’
Broom?”</p>

<p>“My name’s Broom all right,” was the surly
reply, “but I want my proper handle, which is
Captain.”</p>

<p>“What have you done with my brother, you
infernal rascal?” stormed the millionaire.</p>

<p>“Now you ain’t going to get along any better
by cutting up rough and losing your temper like
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
that, pard’ner,” was the cool reminder. “You
may be my guest for quite a time, so let’s you and
me get along peaceable. Otherwise we’ll find a
way to <em>make</em> you keep a civil tongue in your
head.”</p>

<p>“Did you have them searched?” repeated Donald
greedily. “If you did I want my share of it.”</p>

<p>“They were searched, Judson, but they only
had a few dollars; not more than a hundred at
most.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” growled Judson; “then they left some
behind at old Baroni’s place. If we don’t capture
the others, then——”</p>

<p>“Never mind that, now,” commanded Broom;
“you tell ’em what I told you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Judson, and then, turning
to Jack, he said:</p>

<p>“Do you know why you were brought here, Mr.
Fresh?”</p>

<p>“To be robbed, I suppose. I see no other explanation
to it,” was Jack’s reply, with a steady
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>207</a></span>
look at Judson that made the other drop his eyes.
“I always knew you were a bad lot, Judson, but
I never thought you were as bad as this.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me like that. I’m as good as
you,” stormed Judson, although he looked uneasy.
Jack’s shot had told. “To be brief, we
want to make money out of you.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“First of all, you must answer our questions.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way,” approved ‘Bully’ Broom,
stroking his huge beard. “How much money did
you bring with you from America?”</p>

<p>“Very little cash,” replied the millionaire, who
had found it more prudent to control his temper,
“most of the money is in the form of a letter of
credit.”</p>

<p>“Where is that letter of credit?” demanded
Judson, interfering.</p>

<p>“It is in Bomobori with the bankers,” was the
reply, and Jack rejoiced to think that Mr. Jukes
had managed to tell him that, as most of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
money had been left behind at the hostelry with
Captain Sparhawk, who had been appointed a
sort of pay-master to the party.</p>

<p>“Well, now we’ll come down to brass tacks,”
growled Broom, after an interval of thought.
“How much is your liberty worth to you?”</p>

<p>“So that’s your game, is it, you rascally blackmailer?”
sputtered the infuriated millionaire.
“You won’t get a cent out of me.”</p>

<p>But ‘Bully’ Broom only smiled.</p>

<p>“Perhaps in a few days you’ll sing a different
tune,” he said, and something, not in the words,
but in the way they were uttered, sent a cold
shiver down Jack’s spine.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>209</a></span><h2 id='t5020'>CHAPTER XXVIII.—THE FREE-BOOTER’S DEMANDS.</h2></div>

<p>“Well, what do you demand?” was the millionaire’s
next question.</p>

<p>Donald Judson drew ‘Bully’ Broom aside and
whispered to him. The other nodded.</p>

<p>“The least we will take is one hundred thousand
dollars,” he said.</p>

<p>The millionaire grew purple.</p>

<p>“What?” he almost shouted.</p>

<p>“That is for the liberty of both,” said ‘Bully’
Broom coolly. “Fifty thousand for the boy and
fifty thousand for you. If you don’t want to
take the boy, you can pay up fifty thousand and
we will keep him.”</p>

<p>“What would you do with him?”</p>

<p>“Well, the river is full of hungry alligators——”
grinned the wretch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_210' id='Page_210'>210</a></span>“You scoundrel,” thundered Mr. Jukes, “do
you suppose I’d leave him behind, anyway?” Jack
cast him a grateful look. “But what have you
done with my brother, you ruffian?”</p>

<p>“Ah! I was coming to that,” said the rascal
with an insolent smile, “but you can also have him
for the very insignificant sum that I have already
mentioned as being the price for you and
the boy.”</p>

<p>“You’re worth a whole lot more than that,
Jukes,” put in Judson, with an equally insolent
air. “You’re a regular old money-bags, you
know.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never get my money,” raged the millionaire.</p>

<p>“We won’t, eh?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“Hunger makes a lot of difference, Mr. Jukes,”
smiled Broom.</p>

<p>“So you mean to starve us into submission,
eh?” demanded Jack. “I don’t see how such
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_211' id='Page_211'>211</a></span>
rogues can exist. Judson, you are the worst
young hound I ever heard of.”</p>

<p>In high rage the boy’s enemy stepped up to him
and deliberately struck him a heavy blow in the
face, which Jack was, of course, powerless to
return.</p>

<p>“Yes, a cowardly trick like that is in perfect
accordance with what I know of your nature,”
said Jack with menacing quietness.</p>

<p>“You dare say that again,” screamed Donald,
beside himself with anger, “just you dare and
I’ll——” He ended with a shake of his fist.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t scare me, even if I am tied,”
said Jack scornfully.</p>

<p>His perfect calmness added fuel to the fire of
Judson’s rage.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix you,” he yelled, “I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Judson, be quiet,” ordered Broom, and the boy
subsided. “Now,” went on the free-booter to Mr.
Jukes, “your best plan, if you don’t want to lose
a few pounds, will be to make out a check for that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
money. Of course, we’ll have to keep you here
till it’s safely cashed, otherwise you might, and
probably would, stop the check. But——”</p>

<p>“Don’t pay a cent, Mr. Jukes,” interrupted
Jack.</p>

<p>Judson stepped suddenly forward and struck
the helpless lad another stinging blow. It was
such a hard one that Jack’s senses swam for a
minute.</p>

<p>“Shame on you, you young villain,” cried Mr.
Jukes. “He is helpless, otherwise you wouldn’t
dare lay hands on him.”</p>

<p>“Who says so? I could lick him any day,”
swaggered Judson imprudently.</p>

<p>“Have you people no sense of right and honesty
in your compositions?” demanded Mr. Jukes.</p>

<p>But this appeal had no more effect on Broom
than it would have had on adamant.</p>

<p>“We’re no worse than you millionaires, if all
the papers say is true,” he retorted. “You rob
in your way, we rob in ours. We’re not quite so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
refined about it, perhaps. That’s the only difference,
Mr. Jukes.”</p>

<p>“You ruffian! Do you compare business,—legitimate
business,—with your rascally trade?”</p>

<p>“My rascally trade, as you please to term it, is
business,—legitimate business,—to me,” returned
Broom.</p>

<p>“Are we to have any food?” demanded the
millionaire abruptly.</p>

<p>“When you listen to reason, yes.”</p>

<p>“And your idea of reason is that I consent to
pay that preposterous ransom?”</p>

<p>“Your insight does you credit, Mr. Jukes. Sign
that check and you shall have all you want to eat
within the poor limits of my larder, and reasonable
liberty till it is cashed. After that you are
free to go where you will.”</p>

<p>“Our friends will raise a hue and cry for us,”
declared Jack. “They’ll find us and put you
where you belong, behind the bars.”</p>

<p>Broom and young Judson turned away and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>
left the hut by another door from the one by
which they had entered.</p>

<p>“You think they will pay?” asked Broom, with
some anxiety in his voice.</p>

<p>“I’m sure they will. Even a tight-wad old
millionaire will pay up when it comes to a choice
between that and starving.”</p>

<p>“Then you think they are sure to give in?”</p>

<p>“Without a doubt. Then it is only a question
of waiting for the money and getting out.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind that. But I didn’t like what
they said about their friends following us here.”</p>

<p>“Why you said nobody knew the way here
through the swamps but yourself along that path
we came last night.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, but then there’s the river. However,
it would be impossible to see the old fort
from below and anyhow the cliff is fifty feet high
and easily guarded.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are foolish to worry. However,
perhaps if they don’t give in in a day or
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
two we had better be moving along. That young
Ready’s chum, Billy, has given me trouble before.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Broom, “we’ll see how things
come out. If they don’t want to perish in the
swamps they’ll have to come by the river. From
now on I’ll have that cliff guarded.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and if any rescue party comes they’ll get
a big surprise,” was young Judson’s reply.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span><h2 id='t5204'>CHAPTER XXIX.—THE RESCUE PARTY.</h2></div>

<p>“I wish I’d gone along with them,” muttered
Raynor to himself as he slipped on his socks and
boots so as to be ready instantly in case of alarm.
“I don’t like the look of this thing at all.”</p>

<p>For some minutes he sat there listening intently.
But no sound came from outside.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll just join them anyhow,” he resolved
to himself, getting on his feet. “This waiting
is too nerve-racking. I’ll——”</p>

<p>The boy halted where he stood. A loud shout
from the jungle reached his ears.</p>

<p>“Something has happened!” cried the boy.</p>

<p>He reached for his pistol, and hastily buckling
it on, he was about to rush out of the hostelry
when a wild figure appeared.</p>

<p>“Help! There’s murther goin’ on. Help!”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>217</a></span>It was Muldoon, fleeing before three of
Broom’s followers. But as the pursuers came in
sight of the hotel they halted. The next moment
they were in active retreat.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong? What’s happened?” gasped
Raynor.</p>

<p>“Those spalpeens out yonder. They’ve captured
Misther Jukes and Jack Riddy.”</p>

<p>“We must rouse the others at once and go
in pursuit,” decided Billy.</p>

<p>He hurried off to awaken Captain Sparhawk,
while Muldoon aroused Salloo, who in turn, soon
had his native followers astir. It did not take
Captain Sparhawk much longer to get into his
clothes when he heard Billy’s alarming news than
it did for the natives, who were not embarrassed
by garments, to adjust what few they did wear.</p>

<p>It was well they had hastened, for the rascally
landlord of the place had, by this time, aroused
all the half-castes in the place and as, headed by
Captain Sparhawk, they set off into the jungle,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
there was a scattering firing of shots behind
them. Nobody was hurt, however, and they hastened
forward to the place where Muldoon told
them the capture had taken place.</p>

<p>Salloo was consulted and he made a careful
examination of the surroundings. It was considered
quite safe to make this halt, as the tumult
behind them had died out and was probably only
incited by the hotel owner in order to get them
out of the village.</p>

<p>“Must wait till light come,” decided Salloo at
last, “no can make out trail in dark.”</p>

<p>It seemed a whole eternity till dawn, but at last
it grew light and the Malay darted hither and
thither in the vicinity. At last he announced to
Captain Sparhawk that he thought he knew, from
the direction the trail took, the place to which
the prisoners had been conveyed.</p>

<p>“Me think they take um to old fort on river,”
he declared.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>“Then let us go there at once,” said Captain
Sparhawk eagerly. “Is it far?”</p>

<p>“No velly far through jungle. But Salloo no
know trail. Velly bad swamp in there and if
no know trail get in tlubble plenty quick.”</p>

<p>“Then we can’t reach them,” said Billy with a
groan.</p>

<p>“Salloo know other way,” was the reply, “we
go round by ribber. Then climbee cliff, find fort
at top.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s start at once,” said Captain Sparhawk.
“I don’t want to lose a second of time.”</p>

<p>“No, begorry, those spalpeens may have taken
them further on by the time we git there if we
don’t put a good foot forward,” said Muldoon.</p>

<p>Salloo glanced up at the sky. A light, fleecy
haze overspread it.</p>

<p>“Nuther reason we hully,” he said. “Salloo
think big storm come to-mollow. Rain washee
out the tlacks.”</p>

<p>They set off along a narrow track that Salloo
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_220' id='Page_220'>220</a></span>
said would bring them to the river, whose course
they must follow to the deserted fort. The jungle
contained every kind of tropical growth, and huge
ferns as big as trees waved over the path. But
the atmosphere was close and feverish, with a
humid heat that was very tiring. At times they
encountered vines which had grown across the
trail and had to be cut. Some of these were thin
and wiry and could cut like a knife; others were
as thick as a man’s arm and bore brilliant, though
poisonous-looking blossoms of every color.</p>

<p>“Bad traveling,” remarked Captain Sparhawk,
“still I suppose we must expect that on a seldomly
frequented trail.”</p>

<p>“Him get velly bad further on,” was all the
comfort Salloo could offer, “but not velly far to
ribber once we strike udder trail.”</p>

<p>Before long they came to the track he had referred
to which branched off at right angles to
the one along which they had been traveling.</p>

<p>Several miles were covered, however, when it
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
became time to halt for lunch. They made a
hasty meal of canned goods instead of stopping
to light fires, as Salloo thought it would be inadvisable
to advertise their whereabouts by smoke
columns in case the “enemy” had scouts out.
They had hardly resumed their wearisome journey
when they were startled by hearing a cry
from a distance. Salloo came to an instant halt.</p>

<p>“Keep out ob sight, all of you,” he said, “Salloo
go see what makee noise.”</p>

<p>He glided off into the dense vegetation with the
silent, undulatory movements of a snake.</p>

<p>“Begorry, I wonder what that critter was?”
said Muldoon in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I only hope it wasn’t a band
of natives who might prove unfriendly,” muttered
Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, so far we have had more trouble with
white men than with natives,” said Captain Sparhawk,
a remark of which they all felt the truth.</p>

<p>“It might have been monkeys chattering,”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
suggested Raynor, after a pause, during which they
all listened for some sign of Salloo.</p>

<p>“And spaking of the divil,” exclaimed Muldoon,
“look, there’s a monkey looking at us now.
See those two black oys back in the threes?”</p>

<p>He pointed with his forefinger and they all
gazed in that direction. It was Billy who first
discovered the nature of Muldoon’s monkey.</p>

<p>“That’s not a monkey. It’s a big snake! Look
out for yourselves!” he yelled.</p>

<p>“A python!” cried Captain Sparhawk.</p>

<p>He started back and the others did the same.
But Muldoon tripped over a bow and fell sprawling
headlong. As he scrambled to his feet a serpent’s
form appeared above him as it swung from
a big tree. The next instant there was a cry of
horror from them all.</p>

<p>The serpent had made a sudden lunge and a
cry broke from Muldoon as, before he could make
a move to help himself, he was enwrapped in the
spiral folds of the great python.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span>Captain Sparhawk seized his revolver from
his belt and leveled the weapon. But the next
moment he lowered it. To have fired would have
been to imperil Muldoon’s life, and there might
still be a chance of saving him.</p>

<p>The monstrous reptile that had the unfortunate
boatswain in its grip was large, even judged by
the standards of the immense pythons of the New
Guinea and Borneo forests. It must have been
fully thirty-five feet long.</p>

<p>Billy could not endure the sight and put his
hands in front of his eyes. When he removed
them it was to behold a stirring sight.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>224</a></span><h2 id='t5412'>CHAPTER XXX.—IN THE COILS OF A PYTHON.</h2></div>

<p>From the jungle there had darted a lithe figure.
It was Salloo. He had traced the source of the
mysterious cries to a troop of monkeys. He was
returning when Muldoon’s despairing cry broke
on his ears.</p>

<p>The Malay, guessing that there was serious
trouble, glided through the jungle at the best
speed of which he was capable, making his way
swiftly through thickets that a white man could
not have passed at all. There is one weapon with
which a Malay is always armed—his kriss, a
razor-edged sword about two feet long, with a
“wavy” outline. This kriss Salloo now drew
from under his single garment.</p>

<p>One instant it flashed in the sunlight and the
next, during which it was impossible to follow
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
its movements, so swift were they, the python’s
head was severed. But instantly, by a convulsive
movement, its coils tightened and Muldoon emitted
another pitiful cry. But, fortunately, the life
of the snake had departed and soon its coils relaxed
and its gaudily-colored body slipped in a
heap to the ground.</p>

<p>They all sprang forward to Muldoon’s aid, for
the man, powerful and rugged, was almost in a
state of collapse as the result of his terrible experience.
An examination by Captain Sparhawk
soon showed that no bones had been broken, as
they had at first feared, and after restoratives
had been administered, and after a short rest,
Muldoon announced that he was ready to march
on again.</p>

<p>“That was a close shave, Muldoon,” remarked
Raynor, as they pressed onward, after Muldoon
had nearly wrung the hand off Salloo in expressing
his thanks for the Malay’s courageous act,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
which had undoubtedly saved the boatswain’s
life.</p>

<p>“Ouch! Don’t say a wurrud,” groaned the
Irishman, “I thought I was a goner sure. Divil
a bit more of snakes is it I want to see.”</p>

<p>That evening they reached the river, and leaving
them camped, Salloo set off on a scouting expedition.
It was a long time before he returned,
but when he came in he brought good news. He
had located the old fort and reported that the
ruffians who had carried off Mr. Jukes and Jack
were all there enjoying themselves round a big
fire and apparently in no fear of an attack.</p>

<p>“Me see um white boy there, too,” he added.
“Same boy hang round hotel at Bomobori all
time.”</p>

<p>“Donald Judson!” exclaimed Billy. “How
can that be possible? I can’t fit him into this at
all.”</p>

<p>“Well, the question is, now that we have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_227' id='Page_227'>227</a></span>
tracked the rascals, what’s the next move,” said
Captain Sparhawk.</p>

<p>“Me think now good time attack,” counseled
Salloo. “They no think anyone near. Give ’em
heap big surprise.”</p>

<p>“Begorry, that’s well said, naygur,” approved
Muldoon, “I’m aching to git a good crack at
thim.”</p>

<p>After some consultation it was decided to make
the attack at once. If they delayed they would
have to wait till the next night in order to surprise
Broom’s band and there was no telling what
might happen during the twenty-four hours
that would elapse.</p>

<p>Luckily, there was a moon, though it was somewhat
obscured by the haze which Salloo had
drawn attention to as presaging a storm. The
party, piloted by Salloo, started off up the river,
which was low, as the weather had been dry and
there was plenty of room for them to pass between
the bank and the water’s edge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>At last they arrived in sight of the cliff and
Raynor’s heart gave a bound. At the top they
could see the red glare of the camp fire, though
they could not see any of the men.</p>

<p>“There’s one good thing, the ascent of the
cliff will be easy,” said Billy, in a whisper, as he
drew attention to the knotted and twisted vines
that hung down it.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll need no scaling ladders,” rejoined
Captain Sparhawk.</p>

<p>“No need for usum vines,” declared the Malay.
“Salloo know a path to top.”</p>

<p>Telling them to remain where they were, the
faithful fellow set off on another scouting expedition.
His kriss glittered menacingly in the
moonlight as he went on, trying to keep in the
shadow of the cliff. Arrived at the path he knew
of, he glided noiselessly up it, although it was a
steep and tortuous one, and soon was at the top
of the cliff. Through the gloom he made out a
solitary figure sitting on a rock far removed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span>
from the campfire, about which the rest were
gathered. The Malay guessed it was a sentry,
although the fellow was not keeping a very careful
watch and appeared to be half asleep.</p>

<p>“Me fixee you one minute,” grinned the Malay
to himself.</p>

<p>He cast himself on his stomach in the long
grass that grew on the cliff-top and began worming
his way round the sentry so as to approach
him from the rear. He scarcely made a sound
as he moved with wonderful rapidity.</p>

<p>The sentry appeared to shake off his drowsiness
suddenly and rose to his feet just as Salloo
was within a few inches of him. But he left his
rifle leaning against the rock on which he had
been seated. Instantly Salloo leaped from the
grass and the next instant the kriss was at the
thunderstruck sentry’s throat.</p>

<p>“You no speak or me killee,” grated out the
Malay, and one glance convinced the sentry that
Salloo would carry out his threat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>Salloo stooped and picking up a small pebble
cast it over the cliff. It fell almost at the feet of
Captain Sparhawk and Billy, who were anxiously
on the look-out for this signal, which had been
prearranged.</p>

<p>“Forward,” ordered Captain Sparhawk, who
was in the lead. Next came Billy, then Muldoon
and last the natives, some of whom had spears,
and others the peculiar blow-pipes used by the
Papuans to shoot poisoned darts.</p>

<p>The advance was made in silence, and at the
top of the cliff they found Salloo waiting for
them. He was garmentless, having used his
single cloak to tie up the sentry with. Grass
stuffed in the man’s mouth had effectually gagged
him.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Salloo,” said the captain approvingly,
to which the native replied with a grin.</p>

<p>“Now we take him down below and find out
some things from him,” said the Malay.</p>

<p>The helpless prisoner was bundled back down
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
the trail and brought to the camp at the foot of
the cliff. Here he was roped to a tree and the gag
taken out of his mouth. But the sight of Salloo’s
ever-ready kriss kept him from making any outcry.</p>

<p>Yes, he said, the old, fat man and the boy were
all right. They had not been fed though, and
wouldn’t be till a ransom was forthcoming.</p>

<p>This made the whites boil with indignation.
Questioned as to how many were in the band,
he said he did not know, and as he stuck to this
it was thought best not to waste any more time
questioning him.</p>

<p>After a consultation the gag was replaced, but
the ropes were loosened so that with a little exertion
the man could set himself free.</p>

<p>“If, for any reason, we couldn’t come back,
and we left the ropes tight, he would perish,” said
Captain Sparhawk, “and we want no human lives
to our account.”</p>

<p>“Me leave him there starve to death plitty
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_232' id='Page_232'>232</a></span>
quick,” growled Salloo, with a scowl at the crestfallen
prisoner.</p>

<p>At the foot of the cliff all was now dark and
silent as the grave. The moon was obscured by a
cloud and it was an ideal moment for the dash
on the camp to begin.</p>

<p>“We go plenty slow or maybe take big tumble,”
advised Salloo.</p>

<p>He was in advance but Billy was close at his
heels. Cautiously they ascended, taking great
care not to dislodge loose stones which might
have been fatal to their plans. At last the stream
was far below them and the summit of the cliff
within reach.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that a torch flashed
above them, glaring into their upturned faces.</p>

<p>“What’s all this, who are you?” a voice demanded.</p>

<p>“Silence if you value your life,” came from
Captain Sparhawk.</p>

<p>“It’s Donald Judson!” exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>“Billy Raynor,” cried the other in his turn.
“How did you——?”</p>

<p>“Don’t utter another word,” ordered Captain
Sparhawk. “Put your hands above your head,
you young rascal.”</p>

<p>“Not much I won’t!” exclaimed Judson.</p>

<p>He flung his torch full in Billy’s face and then
started at top speed for the camp fire, yelling the
alarm at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>For a minute Billy was in peril of losing his
balance as the torch struck him. But Salloo
caught and held him firmly. The torch dropped
with a splash and hiss into the waters of the river
below.</p>

<p>By this time Salloo scrambled to the cliff summit
and made off after young Judson. Both
reached the camp fire at about the same time.
The others, following close on Salloo’s heels, saw
Donald turn, catch sight of the glittering kriss,
and then, with a yell of dismay, tumble headlong.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
He lay quite still and had apparently been stunned
by the violence of the fall.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” It was Jack’s voice from the
fort and was instantly recognised by Billy.</p>

<p>But by this time the men about the fire, headed
by ‘Bully’ Broom, were on their feet. There was
no time for them to get their weapons, which had
been left inside the fort so that they would not
rust in the damp night air. The battle was a
brief one, although some shots were fired, none of
which, in the excitement, took effect.</p>

<p>Billy, by a clever ruse, brought the engagement
to a speedy termination. In the midst of
the fight he turned toward the cliff and then raising
his voice as if summoning help, he shouted:</p>

<p>“This way, captain. Bring that company up
here. Let the others guard the river.”</p>

<p>“Get out of here, boys,” roared Broom, completely
taken in. “I’ll settle with you later on,”
he cried, shaking his fist as he turned and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>235</a></span>
followed the rout of his followers, who, imagining
they were being pursued by great numbers, made
off at top speed for the jungle, which soon swallowed
them up.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_236' id='Page_236'>236</a></span><h2 id='t5701'>CHAPTER XXXI.—THE JOURNEY RESUMED.</h2></div>

<p>“Thank Heaven that is over,” said Mr. Jukes,
as he sat on an old bench in the fort after he
and Jack had been released. “You may depend
upon it that I shall not forget the part that Salloo
and all of you played in our rescue.”</p>

<p>It was some two hours after the “battle,” if the
rout of the rascals who had captured Mr. Jukes
and Jack could be termed such. The kidnappers’
larder had been ransacked and a good meal enjoyed
by all hands, especially, as may be imagined,
by the two captives who had been without food
for almost twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Donald Judson, looking hang-dog and abject,
was huddled on a bench in a corner of the room.
He had been picked up after the fray, having
shammed insensibility to avoid being injured,
and was easily captured by the victors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>237</a></span>“You certainly came in the nick of time,” said
Jack. “From what I could hear them saying,
that scoundrel Broom was actually contemplating
torturing us if that check was not signed by Mr.
Jukes.”</p>

<p>The millionaire shuddered. His experiences
had greatly affected him.</p>

<p>“That young ruffian over yonder,” he nodded
his head toward Judson, “was the instigator of
the idea to get money out of me, I believe,” he
said. “He ought to be punished severely.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” whined Judson miserably, “I—I—that
fellow Broom did it all.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use of your lying, Judson,” exclaimed
Jack, “you met Broom at Bomobori. It’s
as plain as day now, and furnished him with an
account of as much of our plans as we had confided
to you.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I did,” mumbled Judson sullenly,
“but I didn’t put him up to getting money out of
you.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_238' id='Page_238'>238</a></span>“Nonsense,” said Captain Sparhawk, “you are
as bad as Broom is—worse, in fact, for you are
a lad of decent upbringing.”</p>

<p>No more was said to Judson that night, and
they retired to catch a few hours sleep, leaving
the “carriers” under Salloo on guard. The
Malay amused himself by making hideous faces
at the unfortunate Donald and flourishing his
kriss under his nose. By daylight the wretched
prisoner was half dead from fear. Captain Sparhawk
sternly warned Salloo not to tease him
any more, at which the Malay appeared to be
much surprised.</p>

<p>“Him enemy,” he said, “why no can do what
like with him?”</p>

<p>Breakfast, of which Donald was given his
share, was eaten in the fort, and after that meal
the natives were sent down to the river to bring
up all the supplies which had been left there.
They reported that the prisoner Salloo had made
had succeeded, as they intended he should, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_239' id='Page_239'>239</a></span>
loosening his bonds during the night and had
vanished.</p>

<p>As soon as the boxes containing the wireless
apparatus and the hand-generator arrived, Jack
lost no time in setting them up and as soon as he
raised the yacht sent a full account of Broom’s
rascally conduct to her. The first officer at once
left to notify the authorities and ask that a keen
lookout be kept for Broom’s schooner.</p>

<p>“Broom will never guess that we have any
means of communicating with Bomobori,” the boy
explained, “and if he returns there, will bungle
into a fine trap.”</p>

<p>“Begorry, I hope he does,” commented Muldoon,
“shure that wireless is an illigant invintion
entirely.”</p>

<p>“If Broom is captured, as many other criminals
have been, by its aid, it will have proved its
splendid usefulness once more,” declared Mr.
Jukes. “Ready, you might flash another message
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>240</a></span>
saying that I will give $1,000 to anyone who
captures ‘Bully’ Broom.”</p>

<p>After this had been done, the question arose
of what to do with Donald Judson. They had
no desire to have the young rascal as a traveling
companion, but at the same time they did not see
how they could very well turn him loose in the
jungle in which he might starve to death. It was
a problem that they were still discussing when
Donald himself spoke up in the timid, fawning
voice he affected when in trouble.</p>

<p>“See here,” he said, “if you won’t make trouble
for me maybe I can help you out.”</p>

<p>“In what way?” sharply asked Mr. Jukes.</p>

<p>“Why I saw Broom put a map or something
that looked like one in a cupboard in the room
that door opens into,” said the boy, pointing to
the end of the room. “I thought maybe it might
have something to do with your brother, Mr.
Jukes.”</p>

<p>“Come here at once and show me,” ordered the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>241</a></span>
millionaire. “I don’t suppose it was anything of
great importance,” he added.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” whimpered Donald, “but if it
is will you let it count in my favor?”</p>

<p>“I shall consider that later,” said Mr. Jukes
sternly, as they all followed the boy into the room
he indicated. In one corner was a rough cupboard.
Mr. Jukes opened this and took out a
rolled-up paper. He spread it out on the table
and they all pressed about him.</p>

<p>“It’s a map!” cried Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes, and of this part of the country, too,”
cried Jack. “See, there’s that village, Taroo,
where we stopped two nights ago.”</p>

<p>“And what’s this leading along the river from
this place marked 'Fort’ on the map?” asked Mr.
Judson, his eyes shining as his forefinger traced
a red ink line that zig-zagged along till it left the
river and struck inland to what appeared to be
intended to show a range of mountains. “The
Kini-Balu Mountains,” he read out.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>“The Kini-Balu Mountains!” echoed Salloo,
“me know them. Me bet your brother up there.
One time ‘Bully’ Bloom he helpee Kini-Balu men
fight big battle 'gainst Tariani tribe. Kini-Balus
win and now heap like ‘Bully’ Bloom hide your
brother up there.”</p>

<p>“It is possible,” mused the millionaire, “and—yes,
by jove! Look here.”</p>

<p>Indicated on the map in red letters, at a spot
in the heart of the Kini-Balu country, was a place
marked “Cave.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it possible that that can be
‘Bully’ Broom’s hiding place for the other Mr.
Jukes?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but it appears probable,” rejoined
the millionaire.</p>

<p>“Me membel now sometime ‘Bully’ Bloom go
way from Bomobori long time,” said Salloo, “nobody
know where he go. That time when cruiser
come look for him. Maybe he hide up there.”</p>

<p>“It seems worth trying at any rate,” said Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_243' id='Page_243'>243</a></span>
Jukes, in the manner of one who has reached a
decision.</p>

<p>“It seems reasonable to suppose that if Broom
had taken your brother and his men anywhere
on the island it would have been to some such
inaccessible spot as that,” said Captain Sparhawk.</p>

<p>“Well thin, what’s to privint us going up
among the 'balloon’ men, or whativer they call
thimsilves?” asked Muldoon.</p>

<p>“It may be attended by some danger,” said Mr.
Jukes. “From what Salloo said the Kini-Balu
men are a very war-like tribe. They might attack
us. How about that, Salloo?”</p>

<p>The Malay’s reply was not one calculated to
reassure them.</p>

<p>“Kini-Balu men head hunters,” he said, “Maybe
they no hurt us. But maybe take our heads.
Salloo no 'fraid, though.”</p>

<p>“Then, by golly, neither are we,” declared Muldoon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>244</a></span>After more discussion, it was decided to advance
cautiously into the Kini-Balu country and
then do some scouting to see how matters lay.
If the natives were hostile, and if they were convinced
that Mr. Jukes was really a captive among
them, guarded by their warriors at ‘Bully’
Broom’s orders, then they would return to Bomobori
without risking their lives and come back
with a strong force. If everything appeared to
be pacific, then they would seek out the place indicated
on the map and settle the question of
whether or no it was actually the place of the
pearl hunter’s confinement.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_245' id='Page_245'>245</a></span><h2 id='t5926'>CHAPTER XXXII.—A STORM IN THE JUNGLE.</h2></div>

<p>Two days later, before they turned away from
the river, they heard some news of the Kini-Balus
from a party of natives bound down-stream in
dug-outs. Salloo learned from them that the
tribe was at war, at least so it was supposed by
the canoeists from the fact that they had heard
that the chief of the Kini-Balus had been making
levies of cattle and corn among his subjects.</p>

<p>“That sounds bad,” said Mr. Jukes, when this
news had been interpreted to the party.</p>

<p>“No, him good,” asserted Salloo positively.</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“If Kini-Balus makee war, they leave only
women and old men at home. They no fight us,”
argued the Malay, and they had to admit that
there was a good deal of truth in what he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>246</a></span>“We’re all going to get killed anyhow,” whimpered
Donald, who had been taken along by the
party, much against their will, in consideration
of the services he had rendered in showing them
the hiding place of the map.</p>

<p>“Him heap big coward,” muttered Salloo.
“Boy’s body, girl’s heart.”</p>

<p>It was on the afternoon of the second day that
the storm that Salloo had predicted overtook
them. They were passing through a dense forest
of magnificent trees when the eternal twilight
that reigned under the great branches deepened
till it was almost totally dark. Astonished at this
phenomenon, for it was long before the proper
hour for night to descend, they questioned Salloo.</p>

<p>“Big storm come,” he said, “me thinkee we
better get out of here. Lightning hit a tlee maybe
he killee us.”</p>

<p>The birds of the jungle screamed discordantly,
as if warning each other of what was coming.
Troops of monkeys swung through the trees as if
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>247</a></span>
seeking refuge, and the almost deafening chorus
of insects and lizards gave way to total silence.
It seemed as if nature was holding her breath
preparatory to some great crisis.</p>

<p>“We had better look for some safe place to stay
before it breaks,” counseled Captain Sparhawk.
“A hurricane in the jungle is a serious matter.
Trees are rooted up and struck by lightning and
in the forest it is very dangerous for anyone to
be caught by such a storm.”</p>

<p>“Me findee place,” said Salloo, and struck off
down a dim trail leading toward the river. “Follow
me, evelybody, and hully up.”</p>

<p>They needed no urging. The gloom and quiet
of the forest was overawing. It had begun to
get on their nerves. Under Salloo’s guidance
they soon found themselves at a great mass of
rocks on a high bank overlooking the river. The
great masses of stone were piled in such a way
that the crevices among them formed regular
caves.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_248' id='Page_248'>248</a></span>“We getee in here,” said Salloo, indicating the
largest of them. “I send my men in annuder
one.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going in there,” declared Donald,
“there might be snakes or wild beasts inside.”</p>

<p>“You’d better come in or be blown away,” said
Captain Sparhawk.</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken, before the storm broke
in all its fury. Donald, with a cry of alarm, followed
the others into shelter.</p>

<p>“Gracious, this beats anything I ever saw, even
that storm off the Pamatous,” shouted Jack,
above the shrieking of the wind.</p>

<p>“Him blow more big bimeby,” said Salloo,
“him big storm this. You see.”</p>

<p>The trees swayed violently, and before long,
from their shelter, they saw a big one torn up by
the roots and hurtled from the bank into the river.
The wind grew more violent. The dark air was
filled with flying branches, leaves and sticks.
Birds, large and small, were swept by, powerless
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_249' id='Page_249'>249</a></span>
to contend with the furious gale. Donald was
crouched back in a far corner of their shelter, too
frightened to do anything more than mumble and
whimper.</p>

<p>The river began to rise and add its mighty
voice to the other sounds, although no rain had
yet fallen where they were. The darkness increased,
but suddenly everything was lit up in a
livid glare that made them all blink.</p>

<p>“Lightning,” exclaimed Salloo, “now him comin’.”</p>

<p>Then down came the rain. It literally fell in
sheets, blotting out everything like a fog even
when the constant flashes illuminated the scene.
The water began to pour into their shelter from
above, making it a very uncomfortable place.
Soon the water was up to their knees and in the
cave occupied by the carriers the men stood upright
with their burdens on their heads to keep
them out of the water.</p>

<p>“Gracious, I never saw so much water come
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_250' id='Page_250'>250</a></span>
down in my life,” exclaimed Jack. “It’s a regular—my!”</p>

<p>There had come a flash, a red ribbon of flame,
so blinding that for an instant they could not see.
It was followed by a crack of thunder that seemed
to have split the sky. Donald gave a yell of
alarm.</p>

<p>“Him hittee something close by for sure,” declared
Salloo. He was right. Presently they
saw a tall ceiba tree burst into flame like a torch.
Fanned by the wind, it blazed fiercely even in the
downpour. Its red glare lit up their faces in a
ghostly manner, for it was not more than a few
feet from their place of refuge.</p>

<p>“My, this is awful,” muttered Raynor. “Thank
goodness we got out from under those trees in
time.”</p>

<p>“Amen to that,” said Captain Sparhawk solemnly.</p>

<p>It rained for the rest of that night and in the
morning they were sorry-looking objects.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_251' id='Page_251'>251</a></span>
Everything was wet, and although they had tried to
light a fire during the night, after the first violence
of the storm had abated, they had not succeeded.
But when, shortly before noon, the sun
did come out, it shone down with a heat that made
the whole wet earth steam. Clothes were spread
out on the rocks to dry, as was the rest of the
outfit. Fortunately, the bags the carriers bore
were mostly of waterproof material, so not much
damage was done to the contents.</p>

<p>It was a scene of havoc on which they gazed.
The river ran high and its surface was littered
with the bodies of dead monkeys, snakes, great
trees torn up bodily, and other debris eloquent of
the violence of the hurricane.</p>

<p>All round them lay big trees and the bodies of
countless birds that had been dashed to death. It
was some time before Salloo could persuade a fire
to burn, but among the rocks, in crevices the
rain had not penetrated, he found old dried leaves
and sticks which made capital kindling and at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_252' id='Page_252'>252</a></span>
last they cooked a hot meal, in need of which they
all stood badly.</p>

<p>Then it was off on the long trail again. Late
that afternoon, just as they were making camp,
a party of natives came along the trail. They
carried the skins of numerous beautiful birds that
they had brought down with their blow-pipes.
They were friendly and the boys bought some of
the skins. Afterward Salloo had a long talk with
them and, this being concluded, they kept on their
way while our party went on with its preparations
for spending the night.</p>

<p>Salloo had some news to disclose, he said. The
natives he had been talking to knew the Kini-Balu
Mountains well and told him, after he had
described the cave they were looking for, that it
was a very bad place. Nobody liked to go near it.</p>

<p>“On account of the Kini-Balus?” asked Mr.
Jukes.</p>

<p>“No, on account um ghosts,” rejoined Salloo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_253' id='Page_253'>253</a></span>
“ghost of Taratao, old-time chief of Kini-Balus
haunt him.”</p>

<p>“Begorry, so long as the ghosts ain’t got a
punch it’s sorra a bit I care for ’em,” declared
Muldoon valiantly.</p>

<p>That evening Salloo had a novelty for supper
in the form of the flesh of a huge lizard, or
iguana. At first the boys and their companions
did not want to touch it, for in life it had been a
hideous looking monster. But being pressed by
Salloo, they consented, and found it very good
eating. Its flesh tasted like chicken, though even
more delicate.</p>

<p>It was about an hour after the meal when they
were preparing for bed that Jack complained
that he was feeling poorly. He said he had a
headache and a feeling of vertigo. The others
then admitted experiencing the same symptoms.
Nausea soon succeeded these and ere long they
were all convinced that they had been poisoned
by eating the iguana. The natives, who camped
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_254' id='Page_254'>254</a></span>
some distance off with Salloo, experienced no
such illness but then they had eaten none of the
iguana which, to Captain Sparhawk’s mind, made
it all the more certain that it was the giant lizard’s
flesh that had made them ill.</p>

<p>Salloo was called from the native camp and
bitterly reproached for inducing them to eat it.
He protested that it could not have been the
iguana that had made them ill. Had he not himself
eaten it? But in the end he returned to the
native camp with his head hung down, completely
crushed by what he deemed the injustice of his
white friends in blaming him for their illness.
At first they were not greatly alarmed, not deeming
it possible that they had actually been poisoned,
and Captain Sparhawk administered remedies
from the medicine chest. But, to their
alarm, instead of decreasing in severity, their sufferings
grew more acute as the night wore on.</p>

<p>Their ideas became confused, and as in sea-sickness
in an acute stage, they lay about, not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_255' id='Page_255'>255</a></span>
caring whether they lived or died. If they tried
to rise, their heads swam, their feet tottered.
Thus it was that Salloo found them in the morning
when he came from the native camp.</p>

<p>The faithful fellow was seriously alarmed and
set up a mighty wailing which soon brought his
followers running over. But the sufferers only
turned dull eyes upon them and moaned in their
pain. Plainly they were in such a serious condition
that unless something was done soon to relieve
them, death itself might put an end to their
misery. Salloo looked about him wildly, hoping
to catch some solution to the mystery of this sudden
illness. He raised his eyes upward and his
lips moved as if he were invoking the aid of some
heathen deity.</p>

<p>But suddenly the expression on his countenance
changed. His eyes were fixed on the leaves of a
tree under which the sufferers had passed the
night. For the first time, too, he became aware
of a peculiarly sickening odor in the air. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_256' id='Page_256'>256</a></span>
smelled like carrion. As some huge scarlet flowers
which grew on the tree began to open to the
daylight (they had been closed at night) this
terrible stench became stronger. Salloo uttered
a single shout of comprehension.</p>

<p>“Upas!” It was echoed by his companions,
whom Salloo at once directed to pick up the sufferers
and carry them to some distance. When
the last had been transported, Salloo got water
from a forest pool and poured it over them. One
by one they began to revive. Jack, who was one
of the first to come to, rose dizzily to his feet and
tried to walk. But Salloo gently made him lie
down again. After an hour or so all felt better
and partook of some soup and weak tea.</p>

<p>“Salloo, you are forgiven,” said Captain Sparhawk,
“but never persuade us to eat lizard again.
You came near being the death of us all.”</p>

<p>“Faith, oi was niver so near the Pearly Gates
before,” declared Muldoon emphatically.</p>

<p>“Him no lizard hurt you,” declared Salloo
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_257' id='Page_257'>257</a></span>
vehemently; “lizard heap good. Upas he hurt
you. If I no see it and have you moved away
you plitty soon have died.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Salloo?” asked Mr. Jukes.
“Do you mean our sickness had anything to do
with the tree we camped under?”</p>

<p>“Ebblyting,” was the reply; “him tree was the
upas.”</p>

<p>“I see it all now,” exclaimed Captain Sparhawk.
“That tree was the deadly upas of which
you may have heard. Every one in the Indian
Archipelago knows of it. Within its great red
blossoms are the sepulchre of birds and insects
whose bodies, lying rotting there, give out that
terrible odor which ought to warn all travelers
against it. But we camped when it was getting
dark and the flowers were closed, keeping the
noxious reek from escaping and warning us.
Salloo is right, and if he had not had us dragged
from under it we should have perished miserably.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_258' id='Page_258'>258</a></span>“I remember reading somewhere of the upas,”
said Jack, “but I always thought its deadly qualities
were exaggerated. After our last night’s experience
I’ll know better.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the heat of our camp fire under the
branches had something to do with it, too,” said
Billy.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” declared the captain. “And
then as we sat around after supper we were, unknown
to ourselves, inhaling the deadly vapor
till we grew sick. Instead of moving away before
we grew worse, as we certainly would have if
we had known the cause of our malady, we made
ourselves worse by lying down to sleep with that
poisonous breath as our only atmosphere. Salloo,
your lizard is vindicated, and to show you it
is, the next one you shoot I’ll volunteer to eat.”</p>

<p>But although recovered, they still felt weak
from the effects of their terrible night under the
upas, whose Latin name, if any one wishes to
know it, is <em>antiaris toxicaria</em>. In fact, their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_259' id='Page_259'>259</a></span>
feelings were very like those of persons just getting
over sea-sickness. They felt buoyantly well and
happy, but not yet quite strong enough for the
hard work of the trail. So they remained where
they were till the next day and then pushed on
once more on their quest.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_260' id='Page_260'>260</a></span><h2 id='t6285'>CHAPTER XXXIII.—THE GIANT SPIDERS.</h2></div>

<p>When they resumed their journey the next
morning they encountered a new form of obstacle
in the form of the webs of huge red bird-catching
spiders, whose nets stretched from tree to tree in
the forest, looked like seine nets in a fisherman’s
village hung out to dry, or to make another comparison,
miles of mosquito netting hung between
the tree trunks. Through these webs they had
to make their way for a long distance.</p>

<p>The boys did not like it at all, and Donald
Judson, who was particularly averse to spiders,
slunk in the rear till the natives, with shouts and
yells, cut down the webs that hung across the
trail. The soft silky substance of the webs
struck them in the face and clung glutinously and
covered their clothes with a coating of white
fleece.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_261' id='Page_261'>261</a></span>As they forced their way through this repulsive
feature of New Guinea forest travel, they could,
from time to time, see the hideous forms of the
huge and venomous spiders that had spread the
webs peering at them from dark retreats in the
crevices of trees or else scuttling off on long,
hairy legs to safety. It did not require much
imagination to picture their anger at this ruthless
destruction of their homes. That night they
camped near the edge of a big swamp, and the
two boys, weary of the monotony of the long
march and tired of canned stuff and preserved
goods, volunteered to set out with rifles and see
if they could not bring in something more palatable.</p>

<p>As they had camped early when the swamp
crossed their path, there was plenty of time for
them to go quite a distance in search of game.
In a short time they had brought down two birds
that looked something like partridges, as well as
shooting an odd-looking bird like a huge parrot,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_262' id='Page_262'>262</a></span>
with a gigantic bill and horny head. They were
some distance apart, separated by a brake of
reeds, when Jack heard a sudden cry of alarm
from Billy.</p>

<p>Disregarding the danger of snakes, he pushed
his way through the brake at once. As he came
in sight of Billy, who was standing staring into
the forest as if petrified, Jack, too, received a
shock. Not far from Billy was what he at first
thought was a man. But such a man! Not
even in a nightmare had the boy ever beheld such
a hideous form.</p>

<p>This man, if such he was, was covered all over
with red hair, thick and shaggy, except on the
face, which was darker and bereft of hair, but
from which two yellow eyes glared malevolently.
In an instant the true nature of this creature
flashed upon Jack. It was an orang-outang, and
a monster, too, that stood facing them, its long
arms trailing in front of it. But even though
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_263' id='Page_263'>263</a></span>
stooped over, it was as large as the average man,
with a massive chest and shoulders.</p>

<p>“Take a shot at it, Jack,” urged Billy.</p>

<p>But Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>“It looks too horribly human,” he said. “Besides,
it doesn’t look as if it would attack us. It
seems to be more possessed by curiosity than anything
else.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the boy was right, for after eyeing
them for a few seconds more the monstrous creature
shuffled off for the edge of a big sheet of
water on whose margin they stood, and began
tearing up some sort of water plants and eating
their roots with many grunts of satisfaction. He
waded in almost knee deep, stuffing his bag-like
cheeks full and chewing with huge satisfaction.
The boys gazed at this strange picture with fascination.</p>

<p>But suddenly the monster stopped eating and
stood erect. Its hair began to bristle and it uttered
an angry sort of growl. Apparently it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_264' id='Page_264'>264</a></span>
not fear but anger that possessed this colossus
of the forests as it glanced angrily about it. The
cause of its emotion was not long in appearing.
From the stagnant waters was approaching an
antagonist formidable indeed—a giant saurian—a
crocodile larger than any the boys had ever
seen in any zoo.</p>

<p>The boys naturally expected to see the orang-outang
beat a hasty retreat. But instead it stood
its ground, merely drawing back a few inches
as the crocodile’s hideous snout and scaly body
were successively protruded from the water.
Jack now recalled what Salloo had told him one
night in camp about the orang. The Malay had
said it was the king of the New Guinea forests,
fearing no man, beast or reptile, and this certainly
appeared to be the case in this instance.</p>

<p>Had it wished to beat a retreat to safety, the
mias, as the natives called the red gorilla, might
easily have done so. One leap and he could have
grasped a tree trunk, up which he could have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_265' id='Page_265'>265</a></span>
scrambled in a jiffy. On the contrary, after its
first backward steps, which brought it almost out
of the water, the creature stood upright and, uttering
savage growls, beat on its hairy chest with
its huge arms, producing a sound like the reverberations
of a savage “tom-tom.”</p>

<p>The scaly reptile continued to advance. Perhaps,
to its eyes, the red gorilla was simply a
native, a poor weak human being, such as possibly
had fallen victim to the great crocodile before.
However that may have been, the saurian,
without undue hurry, could be seen to be making
straight for the red ape and, maneuvering so as
to get its monstrous armor-plated tail in position
to give a fatal flail-like sweep, which would fling
the orang-outang into the water, stunning it and
making it an easy prey.</p>

<p>It appeared to flatten itself as it reached shallow
water, its ugly lizard-like legs spread out on
each side of its scaly body almost horizontally.
Then, with a suddenness that made the boys catch
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_266' id='Page_266'>266</a></span>
their breaths in a quick gasp, the monster gave a
sudden leap, aiding this maneuver by its tail,
which it suddenly stiffened as if it had been a
spring.</p>

<p>Its whole length was launched into the air as
it sprang, and for a flash its wide-opened jaws
with their hideous rows of triangular teeth, appeared
to engulf the red ape. But while the boys
were still held spell-bound by this spectacle, such
a one as perhaps no human being but a lone native
hunter had ever beheld before, the red gorilla
gave a mighty leap. It was partly straight up and
partly to one side. As the great jaws of the
saurian came together with a snap like that of a
titanic steel trap, the red ape landed fair and
square on the scaled monster’s back.</p>

<p>Straddling the plated hide, the great hairy legs
gripped the crocodile’s sides as a bronco buster
grips his fractious mount. And now commenced
a struggle between these two denizens of the
deepest New Guinea forests such as the two
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_267' id='Page_267'>267</a></span>
young spectators remembered with photographic
vividness to the end of their lives.</p>

<p>On the part of the crocodile the battle was simply
a series of leaps and wild tail threshings in
an effort to dislodge his nimble foe. The grass
and weeds were mown down as if by a scythe by
the sweeps of the great tail, but the ape held
firm, his little eyes twinkling wickedly. With
one arm it clutched the rough hide firmly, but
the other was waving about like a tentacle seeking
something to grasp.</p>

<p>During the struggle the jaws of the crocodile
had been frequently snapped, but they only closed
on empty air. As in all the saurian tribe, during
this process the upper jaw had pointed nearly
vertically upward, making an opening big enough
to swallow a canoe. Suddenly the watchers saw
the orang’s purpose. All at once the disengaged
arm made a swift sweep forward and grasped
the extended upper jaw.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_268' id='Page_268'>268</a></span>“Great Scott! he’s done for now,” cried Billy.
“That jaw will close and cut his fingers off.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” warned Jack. “Watch. I’ve heard
these creatures can bend rifle barrels as if they
were made of lead. Perhaps—look!”</p>

<p>The orang suddenly shifted his position. He
was now kneeling on the crocodile’s back, his
knees braced firmly on its armor-plated neck and
his second arm aiding the first in the task of
keeping those jaws, once apart, from ever coming
together again. Then summoning every
ounce of that strength that has made the orang
the most dreaded of all the forest animals in
that part of the world, even the Bornean tiger
owning his supremacy, the red gorilla gave one
grand wrench.</p>

<p>There was a tearing sound as of a tree being
torn from its roots, and the alligator’s body
writhed and threshed about convulsively. The
great ape sprang free from the scaly monster
and with hoarse laughter that sounded like the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_269' id='Page_269'>269</a></span>
merriment of a maniac, it gazed on the saurian’s
struggles. But it was not destined to see the end
of them. In its agony the great crocodile instinctively
made for the water and was soon out
of sight, threshing and writhing until a clump
of water-cane hid it from sight.</p>

<p>Then, and not till then, did the orang take its
eyes from its conquered enemy. But when it
had seen the last of it, the hairy creature turned
and appeared to be contemplating fresh victory.
The lust of battle was in its wicked little eyes.</p>

<p>“Down, Billy, down with you quick,” warned
Jack, pulling his chum aside in the thicket. “If
it comes this way, shoot at once. I wouldn’t
want to come to close quarters with a creature
like that. I thought Salloo was drawing the long
bow when he told me about the <em>mias</em>, as he called
it, but he didn’t put it on thick enough.”</p>

<p>“If only we’d had a camera,” was Billy’s regret.
But for the next few moments there were
more important things to think about. The orang
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_270' id='Page_270'>270</a></span>
stood upright, looking about him in a truculent
manner. It almost appeared as if, now that his
battle with the saurian was over, he had recollected
the human figure he had seen not long before,
but had paid little heed to it in his haste to
make his evening meal among the water plants.</p>

<p>In fact, he started shamblingly toward the
brake where the boys were concealed with leveled
rifles and fingers on triggers. But the great
creature’s life was spared, for that time at least,
for had the boys fired he must have fallen at the
first bullets from the high-powered rifles. After
advancing a few paces, he changed his mind and,
grumbling to himself, he shuffled off and was
soon lost in the gloom of the forest.</p>

<p>“We ought to have shot him, Jack,” muttered
Billy as they started back to camp with what
game they bagged.</p>

<p>“What, kill a fine old warrior like that without
cause? Could you have done it, Billy?”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_271' id='Page_271'>271</a></span>“Um—well—er—no, I don’t believe I could,”
rejoined his chum. “After all, that crocodile
started the scrap and—and I guess every American
likes a good fighter.”</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_272' id='Page_272'>272</a></span><h2 id='t6554'>CHAPTER XXXIV.—A FIGHT WITH A HORNBILL.</h2></div>

<p>“Now me showee you something.”</p>

<p>It was during the noon rest the next day and
the Malay had asked the whites to come a little
distance apart from the camp to a fine-looking
banyan tree. They watched him with interest
as with the axe he cut down several lengths of
bamboo from a nearby cluster, and, pointing the
ends sharply, having first separated the lengths
into bits about two feet long, began driving them
into the yielding bark of the tree. In this way
he had soon made the first four rounds of a
primitive ladder.</p>

<p>Although, as yet, he had given them no hint
of the object of all this, they were all sure that he
had something really of interest to show them
and forbore asking questions till he was ready
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_273' id='Page_273'>273</a></span>
to explain the mystery. Salloo had driven the
tenth round of his queer ladder and was about
ten feet from the ground, when Jack drew everybody’s
attention to a strange hissing sound that
appeared to come from within the tree.</p>

<p>“Look out for snakes, Salloo,” he warned. But
the Malay only nodded his head confidently and
smiled. Donald glanced about nervously. Even
Captain Sparhawk looked apprehensive. As for
Muldoon, he shouted, “This is no place for a son
of St. Patrick,” and fled back to camp.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Salloo?” asked Mr. Jukes.
“Are you in trouble?”</p>

<p>“No trouble, Missel Boss,” rejoined Salloo.
“Only bit what you callee good luck,” grinned the
Malay, looking down on them and continuing
his work.</p>

<p>“How good luck?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“You see plenty soon,” was the cryptic reply,
and the Malay drew another sharp-pointed peg
from his girdle and drove it in with vigorous
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_274' id='Page_274'>274</a></span>
strokes of the axe. While he did this, the hissing
continued, mingled with a hoarse roaring like
that which might be emitted by a disabled foghorn.
Moreover, they could now see that a few
feet above Salloo’s head was an object which alternately
was thrust out from the tree trunk and
withdrawn. It was white and sharp-pointed, like
one of the pegs he was driving. It was assuredly
not a snake’s head, as they had for a minute
thought, but what was it?</p>

<p>“What’s that right over your head, Salloo?”
asked Captain Sparhawk.</p>

<p>“Him buld (bird), captain. Him plentee much
bigee buld.”</p>

<p>“Oh, only a bird,” said Mr. Jukes in a disappointed
voice. “What sort of a one?”</p>

<p>“Him hornbill. Ole hen hornbill. She on nest.
Old man hornbill he shut her up in there so she
no leave eggs. Him put mud over crack in tree
so as she no put nothing but her beak out. That
the way he feedee her.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_275' id='Page_275'>275</a></span>So that was the explanation of that object that
darted in and out, and also of the hissing and
grunting sounds. Looking closer, they now saw
that at the spot where the bill still kept darting in
and out there was a big longitudinal patch of mud
which walled the hen hornbill up as effectually
as certain prisoners were “walled up” in the days
of old. As Salloo got within reaching distance
of the nest, he raised his axe and smashed the
mud wall before any of the party could check
him. The next instant his bare arm was plunged
fearlessly into the orifice and came out with his
fingers clutching the old hen by the neck. In a
moment she was fluttering, with her neck wrung,
at the adventurers’ feet.</p>

<p>“Say, Salloo, you shouldn’t have done that,”
called up Jack indignantly. “That’s a shame.”</p>

<p>The rest echoed his indignation at what seemed
an act of wanton cruelty. Salloo only looked
astonished.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_276' id='Page_276'>276</a></span>“Him plenty good eat. Roast hornbill plenty
fine.”</p>

<p>“You see, he takes a different point of view
about these things than we do,” said Captain
Sparhawk. “You can’t blame him. Still I wish
we could have prevented it.”</p>

<p>They examined the dead hornbill with much interest.
It was a gorgeous bird, almost as big as
a turkey, with a bill of a size altogether disproportionate
to even its large size. This beak was
like a gigantic parrot’s bill and the horny structure
extended over almost the entire head of the
bird. It was not unlike the one the boys had shot
the night before and thrown away as not good for
food.</p>

<p>“Plentee eggs in there,” said Salloo as he came
down, “but they no good eat.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad there were no young ones
to be starved through our interference,” said
Billy, and the others felt as he did.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_277' id='Page_277'>277</a></span>“Say, I’m going to have a look at that nest,”
said Jack suddenly.</p>

<p>“All right. But look out you don’t fall and
break your neck,” warned Raynor. Jack went
nimbly up Salloo’s queer ladder and soon reached
a height where he could see into the nest, which
was built in a cavity of the tree and had afterward
been carefully walled up with mud,
strengthened by weaving reeds into it. Jack was
still examining the nest when a sudden shadow
fell over him. He looked up and above him he
saw, with somewhat of a shock, a great bird
whose plumage flashed brilliantly in the sun and
whose huge beak snapped viciously at the boy.</p>

<p>“Look out, look out, him father hornbill,” cried
Salloo from the ground.</p>

<p>The hornbill made a swoop at Jack, aiming
with that cruel beak straight for his eyes. The
boy put up an arm to defend himself, but the bird
seized it with its parrot-like claws, scratching it
badly, and all the while it kept up a beating of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_278' id='Page_278'>278</a></span>
its wings that blinded the boy. Then the bird
suddenly changed its tactics. It swooped off
and then made a swift dash at the boy’s head.
It was well for Jack that he had on his stiff sun
helmet or his skull would have been cracked like
an egg by that huge, horny bill. As it was, the
helmet was ripped open.</p>

<p>Those below called on him to come down.
But the attacks of the great bird so blinded and
bewildered him that he was unable to move a
step. Billy, at the order of Captain Sparhawk,
brought a rifle from the camp, but so close did
the bird stay to the boy that there was danger
in using it. Even the most expert of shots would
have been quite as likely to hit Jack as the enraged
hornbill.</p>

<p>Salloo had sprung into the tree, and with his
ever ready <em>kriss</em> was ascending to the rescue
when Captain Sparhawk saw an opportunity.
The rifle was already at his shoulder and, as
the hornbill rose and hovered for an instant
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_279' id='Page_279'>279</a></span>
before making another plunge at Jack’s head, his
finger pressed the trigger. A splendid shot, a
broken wing, the huge bird fluttered to the earth
and flopped and screamed on the ground till its
strugglings were put an end to by another bullet.
Jack remained where he was for a few seconds
to recover his nerves and then, still somewhat
shaken by his experience, he descended.</p>

<p>His arm was badly scratched and Captain
Sparhawk was opening the medicine chest when
Salloo intervened. He quickly gathered a handful
of a plant that exuded a sort of thick milk.
Crushing the gathered stems on a stone, he soon
had a quantity of this juice, which he spread on
the wounds. The irritation at once left them and
Salloo promised a speedy cure. But it may be
said that Jack had no appetite for roast hornbill
that night.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_280' id='Page_280'>280</a></span><h2 id='t6748'>CHAPTER XXXV.—THE HEART OF NEW GUINEA.</h2></div>

<p>The expedition now found itself advancing
through forest that grew sparser as they progressed.
The ground was rapidly becoming more
rugged. Close to them now towered the range
known as the Kini-Balu among the wild recesses
of which the tribe of that name made its home.
Constant vigilance was the watchword of the
hour now. Salloo would permit no fires to be
lighted, and he and his followers were constantly
scouting in front of the party, while additional
watch was kept at the rear and on both flanks.</p>

<p>It was dangerous, thrilling work, but the boys,
who loved adventure, relished every moment of
it. But Donald Judson lived a life of misery.
Every rustle in the bush made him turn pale.
He was constantly giving false alarms in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_281' id='Page_281'>281</a></span>
night and the boys heartily wished he had been
left behind. One afternoon—they were right in
the mountains now—Salloo halted the party with
a quick gesture.</p>

<p>“Two men ahead of us. Up the mountain.
Salloo go, look, see.”</p>

<p>He glided off with his usual snake-like agility
and vanished in a flash, while the party waited
behind a mighty rock, for cover of the forest kind
was growing scarce now. A wilder region would
have been hard to imagine. The cliffs and mountains
were of all sorts of extravagant shapes.
Some of the larger rocks and peaks took on the
outlines of monstrous animals. But they were
still following a trail which was undoubtedly the
one set down in red ink on Broom’s map.</p>

<p>Through the glasses, which they were able to
use without being observed, by crouching down in
the coarse grass, they could see Salloo advancing
toward the two figures on the mountain side. As
he went he was making the peace sign, extending
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_282' id='Page_282'>282</a></span>
his arms as if inviting the others to attack him at
their will. But as far as they could see, the
meeting was friendly enough. Salloo conversed
with the two men of the mountain for a long time.
Then he could be seen retracing his steps.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded everybody as he returned
to the camp.</p>

<p>“Ebblyting good so far,” reported Salloo.
“Those two men velly old men. They left behind
when tribe go to war in the north.”</p>

<p>“Then the country is free of danger?” cried
Donald.</p>

<p>Salloo turned a look of contempt on him and
did not answer. Addressing the others, he continued:</p>

<p>“They say they know of cave. But no know
if white man is there,” went on the Malay.</p>

<p>“Would they be willing to guide us to it?” inquired
Mr. Jukes.</p>

<p>“That me no know yet. Me go see ’em again
to-night,” replied Salloo. “They say nobody but
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_283' id='Page_283'>283</a></span>
old men, women and children left behind now
tribe go to war. So maybe they no afraid to
show us. You pay ’em good?”</p>

<p>“Anything, any sum at all,” was the response
of the millionaire. “No sum is too great to restore
my brother to his family.”</p>

<p>When night fell Salloo left the camp again and
did not return till midnight. He brought the
news that the two old men would guide them for
three pieces of gold each. They did not want
the coins to spend, explained Salloo, but to pierce
and wear round their necks as ornaments.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it six each,” declared Mr. Jukes, “if
they lead us aright.”</p>

<p>There was little sleep for anybody that night,
and soon after daybreak the two old men appeared
in the camp. They were odd-looking old
fellows; unclothed except for a breech cloth, and
were daubed with red and yellow earth, signifying
that their tribe was at war, although their
age barred them from taking part.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_284' id='Page_284'>284</a></span>At Salloo’s suggestion, only himself, Mr.
Jukes, Jack and Billy were to accompany the
guides. The others were to remain behind and
keep as well under cover as they could till the
rest returned with success or failure. Final instructions
having been given, they set off behind
the two old men, who chattered volubly with Salloo
as they went. They knew of the cave, it
appeared, but nothing more, for they did not
come from that part of the mountains.</p>

<p>The next day they were not far from the cave,
their aged guides told them, and Salloo enjoined
the strictest caution in proceeding. If they met
a returning war party, their position would be
ticklish in the extreme, he declared, and they
readily agreed with him.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that, high up on the
mountain side, they became aware of a dark hole.
The two old men chattered and pointed, and then
Salloo said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_285' id='Page_285'>285</a></span>“There him cave. You wait here. Salloo go,
look, see.”</p>

<p>He made off up the mountain with the two old
tribesmen, while the others waited with what
patience they could for his return. The boys had
never seen Mr. Jukes so nervous. He could not
keep still under the tension, but paced to and fro,
regardless of Salloo’s advice to keep under cover.</p>

<p>“He is taking his time,” said Jack after a
long interval.</p>

<p>“Perhaps something has happened to him,”
said Mr. Jukes, apprehensively. “We’d better
have our pistols ready. Hark! what was that?”</p>

<p>There was a rustling in the bushes near at
hand and they all sprang to their feet, only to
burst into laughter a minute later when a rock
coney, or small rabbit, emerged, looked at them
for an instant and then vanished.</p>

<p>“That shows how we are keyed up,” said Jack.
“We’ve got to keep our nerve or we shall be useless
if any emergency did happen.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_286' id='Page_286'>286</a></span>As he spoke, something whizzed over their
heads and then sank quivering in the ground not
far from them. They looked round and saw
standing not far off two hideous natives, with
frizzed hair and painted faces and bodies. Both
were wounded and apparently had been sent back
from “the front.” But still there was a chance
that they might be the advance guard of a big
body of troops.</p>

<p>“We friends,” cried Jack, giving the peace sign
as he had seen Salloo give it.</p>

<p>The natives merely stared, and there is no
knowing what might have been the outcome, but
at that moment there came a hail from high up on
the mountain and the old tribesmen and Salloo
began coming toward them. The natives awaited
their coming with their eyes fixed on the whites.
As soon as Salloo and the others arrived there
was a long confab and Salloo explained that the
two warriors said that the main body of the savage
troops was not far off, and that they had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_287' id='Page_287'>287</a></span>
sent back on account of their wounds. They had
thrown the spear because they thought the whites
were coming to invade their country. When Salloo
explained the object of their errand, everything
appeared to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>“Now we go to the cave,” said Salloo, at the
end of these negotiations. “Him velly big one,
me think.”</p>

<p>“Did you—did you see any trace of my
brother?” asked Mr. Jukes anxiously.</p>

<p>“Me no see anything yet,” was the reply. “Me
only go little way into cave.”</p>

<p>“Then come, let us start at once,” said Mr.
Jukes, stepping nimbly over the rough ground, in
spite of his cumbersome build.</p>

<p>As Salloo had said, the cave was a large one.
It ran back fully a mile under the mountain.
But they paid little attention to its natural beauties,
so eager were they to find some trace of
Jerushah Jukes. To one side was a swiftly flowing
stream. They did not doubt that it came
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_288' id='Page_288'>288</a></span>
from a waterfall, the noise of which they could
hear in the distance.</p>

<p>Before long they stood in front of the waterfall,
a beautiful ribbon of water falling fully a
hundred feet into a clear pool. A sort of mist
hung over the pool caused by the spray, which
was lighted by a rift in the rocks above. It was
a lovely sight and even in their anxiety to get on
they could not help standing and admiring it for
a few minutes.</p>

<p>“By the way, Salloo,” said Jack abruptly, “how
about that ghost that is supposed to haunt the
cave?”</p>

<p>“Me no know. Me——”</p>

<p>“Look, look, the ghost!” cried Raynor suddenly.
He pointed straight in front of him at
the fall.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Jack as he too perceived
an apparition that appeared to rise out of
the waters. Salloo fell flat on his face in terror
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_289' id='Page_289'>289</a></span>
and so did the two old natives, who had been
their guides.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Mr. Jukes sharply.
“I see nothing. I—for heaven’s sake!”</p>

<p>Out of the mist of the pool he had seen advancing
toward him as he stepped forward the
gigantic form of a man. Then he glanced again.</p>

<p>The ghost was Mr. Jukes himself, who certainly
had nothing spiritualistic about him. The explanation
of the queer sight struck the boys and
the millionaire at the same instant. The sun,
shining through the rift, was reflected upon the
wet rock which in turn projected their figures
against the watery mist that hung above the
pool.</p>

<p>“And so that’s the ghost that’s been scaring
the natives to death,” said Jack. “Get up, Salloo,
and I’ll show you how the trick is done.”</p>

<p>After a brief demonstration the Malay was
satisfied, but the two old men were unconvinced.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_290' id='Page_290'>290</a></span>
They mumbled and were ill at ease till that part
of the cave was left behind.</p>

<p>“Hullo, here’s a path leading up past the waterfall,”
cried Jack suddenly.</p>

<p>“So there is. Let’s see where it goes,” cried
Billy. They started up the slippery footway
very slowly so as to avoid the consequences of
a slip. As they went it grew lighter. They were
coming to the upper world once more. A minute
later and they emerged upon a small plateau in
the heart of the mountains. It was surrounded
by steep precipices. In the centre stood a group
of bamboo huts.</p>

<p>At sight of the white men, several women and
children set up a shrill cry. Suddenly above the
hub-bub came a voice that brought a thrill to
them all:</p>

<p>“Has help come at last?”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a href='images/i05f.jpg'><img src='images/i05.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0004' style='width:386px;height:600px;' /></a>
<p class='caption'>“Has help come at last?”</p>
</div>

<p>From behind one of the huts had stepped a tall,
angular figure, wearing ragged white clothes and
a battered sun helmet. Perched on his nose were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_291' id='Page_291'>291</a></span>
a pair of huge horn-rimmed spectacles, a ragged,
unkempt beard covered his face and his hair hung
in matted locks about his shoulders.</p>

<p>At the sight of him, Mr. Jukes gave a gasp
and then a glad cry.</p>

<div class='pbb'><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_292' id='Page_292'>292</a></span><h2 id='t7041'>CHAPTER XXXVI.—FOUND AT LAST!</h2></div>

<p>“Oh, my brother,” cried Mr. Jukes, “I can
hardly believe we’ve found you at last.”</p>

<p>“Thank God! you have, Jacob,” returned the
other fervently. “For a moment I thought that
you were only one of the fantastic visions that
have visited my brain lately.”</p>

<p>“My poor brother,” exclaimed the millionaire,
“but now thank heaven you are restored to your
friends.”</p>

<p>“But how did you ever find me? I never
deemed it possible that rescuers could find their
way to this place where that villain Broom, after
stealing the pearl, marooned me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, so the pearl is gone,—but never mind that
now. I would not have given your life for an
ocean-full of pearls,” declared the millionaire
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_293' id='Page_293'>293</a></span>
happily, “but I must introduce our friends who
have shared with me the hardships of the trail.”</p>

<p>The boys, and then Salloo, added their congratulations
to Mr. Jukes, while the women and
children gathered round and chattered frantically.
It was plain that they objected to all this,
yet did not see how to stop it. The white men’s
weapons glinted menacingly and there were no
warriors in the village.</p>

<p>“And now let us hasten away from here,” said
Jerushah Jukes. “The men are off on a fighting
expedition and I might have escaped but without
food or weapons I could never have made my
way to the coast through the jungle. I suppose
that is the reason they did not tie me up.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” said the millionaire, “but I’m
forgetting something,” and he doled out to the
two old men a reward, much over what they had
demanded. They chattered their thanks glibly,
making all sorts of gesticulations of gratitude.</p>

<p>“It’s all like a dream to me so far,” said Jerushah
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_294' id='Page_294'>294</a></span>
Jukes, as they made their way back through
the cave and past the “haunted” waterfall.
“Broom sent me up here with a guard of his men.
The tribe appeared to be friendly to him and
agreed to keep me prisoner as long as he wished.
But my poor crew? What has become of them?”</p>

<p>“That we do not know yet,” said Mr. Jukes,
“but we will talk later. I want to put all the
distance I can between this tribe and our party as
soon as we can. Those women will give the
alarm although they dared not make an active
protest.”</p>

<p>But as they emerged from the cave they met
with a rude shock. A party of warriors with
frizzed hair and war-paint daubing their bodies
barred the way.</p>

<p>At first the tribesmen stood motionless with
astonishment at the sight of a party of white
men emerging from their secret cave. But the
next instant they broke into a savage volley of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_295' id='Page_295'>295</a></span>
shouts and yells and raised their spears and cruel-looking
war clubs.</p>

<p>“We have come too late, my poor brother,”
groaned Mr. Jukes. But suddenly Salloo raised
his voice. He spoke in tones of loud authority.
The spears and clubs were lowered. He turned
to Mr. Jukes and in a quick low voice said:</p>

<p>“Give me um map. Quick, our lives depend
on him.”</p>

<p>The millionaire lost no time in producing
‘Bully’ Broom’s map. The most be-frizzed of
the natives pored over it for several minutes.
Then one of them said in fair English:</p>

<p>“You come from Chief Broom; all right, you
may go. He tell us to keep white man till he send
for him. You show Broom’s map. He all right.
Goo’ bye,” and the warriors went on.</p>

<p>Thus by the clever Malay’s strategy he had
told the warriors, who had returned unexpectedly,
that the white men had been sent by ‘Bully’
Broom,—they were saved from disaster. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_296' id='Page_296'>296</a></span>
the tribesmen had demanded proof of Salloo’s
story and, in the nick of time, he had luckily
thought of the map which satisfied their suspicions
at once, for Broom was the only white man,
except the prisoner, who had ever visited the secret
cave.</p>

<p>The return to the camp was made without incident
and Jack, on reaching it, at once rigged
up his wireless apparatus and flashed to the <span class='it'>Sea
Gypsy</span> the glad news of the rescue of the millionaire’s
brother. But, a few minutes later, he,
in his turn, was receiving good tidings. Broom
had returned to Bomobori and was arrested
while he was recruiting a crew to make a dash
into the jungle and intercept the Jukes’ party. He
was apprehended while rowing ashore from a
native craft.</p>

<p>As the officers of the law seized him, he was
seen to throw something into the water. One of
the native oarsmen instantly dived after the object
and succeeded in grabbing it before it
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_297' id='Page_297'>297</a></span>
reached the bottom. It proved to be the great
pearl, “The Tear of the Sea.” And there was
yet more intelligence of a kind to hearten them
after all their tribulations in the wild jungles of
New Guinea.</p>

<p>The first officer of the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>, having received
news of a mysterious schooner anchored
in a cove up the coast, resolved to do a little amateur
detective work. He found that she was
none other than the famous <em>South Sea Lass</em>. Securing
the co-operation of the authorities, the
vessel was raided one night and her small crew
easily overpowered. Then cries were heard from
below and on the removal of the hatches the crew
of the <em>Centurion</em>, or what remained of them—for
five had died from privation—were discovered.
They had refused to join Broom’s band
and he was afraid to let them loose, so they had
been confined in the almost unlivable hold ever
since their capture. Since Broom’s arrest, the
Australian authorities had cabled that he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_298' id='Page_298'>298</a></span>
wanted there for piracy and other crimes and he
had been sent to Melbourne on a mail steamer.
It may be added here that British justice was
dealt out with a heavy hand to the ruffian and
his many victims were fully avenged. His crew
was tried and sentenced in Bomobori and all received
heavy terms of imprisonment. Thus were
the South Seas rid of one of the chief of their
many freebooters.</p>

<p>The long march back to Bomobori was made
without anything of particular interest occurring
and one morning they stood on a rise overlooking
the harbor. There lay the <em>Sea Gypsy</em> with
the dear old Stars and Stripes flying, and the
ship dressed in gay bunting; for by wireless Jack
had notified those on board of the time of their
arrival. A few hours more and they were among
their friends again with their strange experiences
behind them.</p>

<p>As there was no reason for staying in Bomobori,
except to take on board the survivors of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_299' id='Page_299'>299</a></span>
the <em>Centurion’s</em> crew, the <em>Sea Gypsy</em> steamed out
of the harbor the next day, being saluted as she
went, a compliment which she returned with her
rapid-fire gun. Watching them from the wharf
were two figures. One a tall agile Malay, who,
with tears in his eyes, watched the yacht till she
was hull-down on the horizon. It was Salloo.
He had been well rewarded for his services which
indeed, as Mr. Jukes said, were beyond price; but,
as he watched the departure of his white friends,
his thoughts were only with them and not with
what were, to him, the riches of a lifetime.</p>

<p>The other watcher turned away with a sneer,
jingling the money Mr. Jukes had left him in his
pockets:</p>

<p>“So I’ve got to stick round this hole till I can
get a steamer home,” grumbled Donald Judson,
for, as our readers will have guessed, it was he.
“If it hadn’t been for those boys I might have
gone home in comfort on the yacht. Well, maybe
some day I’ll get even with them.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_300' id='Page_300'>300</a></span>On the voyage home a stop was made at the
Pamatou Islands; the glad news of the rescue
had already been wirelessed home, and there was
no great hurry except Mr. Jukes’ desire to get
back to his business affairs after a romantic adventure
he would never forget. As the <span class='it'>Sea
Gypsy</span> dropped anchor in the well-known harbor,
a fleet of canoes dashed out to welcome her,
among them you may be sure those of Anai and
his friend, who wept tears of joy at seeing their
white “chums” once more. Mr. Jukes, his speculative
instinct once more in the ascendent, bought
a large quantity of pearls on which he subsequently
realized a good profit.</p>

<p>“But we must hurry home,” he said one day.
“My business will be going to rack and ruin without
me and besides I’ve run out of dyspepsia pills.
I only hope I didn’t ruin my digestion in the
jungle.”</p>

<p>And here the adventures of the Ocean Wireless
Boys on the Pacific must be brought to a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_301' id='Page_301'>301</a></span>
close, except that it might be mentioned that
pretty Helen Dennis, whose father’s ship was in
port on the return of the <em>Sea Gypsy</em>, now wears
a very pretty locket, set with South Sea pearls—the
gift of Jack Ready. And so, till we meet
them in the next volume of this series, we will
wish the lads and their friends good-bye.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>BEN STONE AT OAKDALE.</span></p>

<p>Under peculiarly trying circumstances
Ben Stone wins his way at
Oakdale Academy, and at the
same time enlists our sympathy,
interest and respect. Through the
enmity of Bern Hayden, the loyalty
of Roger Eliot and the clever work
of the “Sleuth,” Ben is falsely accused,
championed and vindicated.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>BOYS OF OAKDALE ACADEMY.</span></p>

<p>“One thing I will claim, and that
is that all Grants fight open and
square and there never was a sneak among them.” It was
Rodney Grant, of Texas, who made the claim to his friend,
Ben Stone, and this story shows how he proved the truth
of this statement in the face of apparent evidence to the
contrary.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>RIVAL PITCHERS OF OAKDALE.</span></p>

<p>Baseball is the main theme of this interesting narrative,
and that means not only clear and clever descriptions of
thrilling games, but an intimate acquaintance with the
members of the teams who played them. The Oakdale
Boys were ambitious and loyal, and some were even disgruntled
and jealous, but earnest, persistent work won out.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>OAKDALE BOYS IN CAMP.</span></p>

<p>The typical vacation is the one that means much freedom,
little restriction, and immediate contact with “all outdoors.”
These conditions prevailed in the summer camp of
the Oakdale Boys and made it a scene of lively interest.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>THE GREAT OAKDALE MYSTERY.</span></p>

<p>The “Sleuth” scents a mystery! He “follows his nose.”
The plot thickens! He makes deductions. There are
surprises for the reader—and for the “Sleuth,” as well.</p>

<p><span class='bold'>NEW BOYS AT OAKDALE.</span></p>

<p>A new element creeps into Oakdale with another year’s
registration of students. The old and the new standards
of conduct in and out of school meet, battle, and cause
sweeping changes in the lives of several of the boys.</p>

<p>FROM BOYHOOD TO MANHOOD (The Life of Benjamin Franklin). By <em>Wm. M. Thayer</em>.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin was known in the
scientific world for his inventions and
discoveries, in the diplomatic world because
of his statesmanship, and everywhere,
because of his sound judgment,
plain speaking, and consistent living.</p>

<p>FROM FARM HOUSE TO WHITE HOUSE (The Life of George Washington). By <em>Wm. M. Thayer</em>.</p>

<p>The story of the hatchet and other
familiar incidents of the boyhood and
young manhood of Washington are included
in this book, as well as many
less well-known accounts of his experiences
as surveyor, soldier, emissary,
leader, and first president of the United States.</p>

<p>FROM LOG CABIN TO WHITE HOUSE (The Life of James A. Garfield). By <em>Wm. M. Thayer</em>.</p>

<p>It was a long step from pioneer home in Ohio where James
A. Garfield was born, to the White House in Washington, and
that it was an interesting life-journey one cannot doubt who reads
Mr. Thayer’s account of it.</p>

<p>FROM PIONEER HOME TO WHITE HOUSE (The Life of Abraham Lincoln). By <em>Wm. M. Thayer</em>.</p>

<p>No President was ever dearer to the hearts of his people
than was homely, humorous “Honest Abe.”</p>

<p>To read of his mother, his early home, his efforts for an
education, and his rise to prominence is to understand better his
rare nature and practical wisdom.</p>

<p>FROM RANCH TO WHITE HOUSE (The Life of Theodore Roosevelt). By <em>Edward S. Ellis, A. M.</em></p>

<p>Every boy and girl is more or less familiar with the experiences
of Mr. Roosevelt as Colonel and President, but few
of them know him as the boy and man of family and school
circles and private citizenship.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis describes Theodore Roosevelt as a writer, a hunter,
a fighter of “graft” at home and of Spaniards in Cuba, and
a just and vigorous defender of right.</p>

<p>FROM TANNERY TO WHITE HOUSE (The Life of Ulysses S. Grant). By <em>Wm. M. Thayer</em>.</p>

<p>Perhaps General Grant is best known to boys and girls as
the hero of the famous declaration: “I will fight it out on this
line if it takes all summer.”</p>

<p>A new boy moves into town. Who is
he? What can he do? Will he make
one of the school teams? Is his friendship
worth having? These are the
queries of the Ridgewood High Students.
The story is the answer.</p>

<p class='line' style='font-style:italic;'>Rex Kingdon in the North Woods</p>

<p>Rex and some of his Ridgewood friends establish a camp fire in
the North Woods, and there mystery, jealousy, and rivalry enter
to menace their safety, fire their interest and finally cement their
friendship.</p>

<p class='line' style='font-style:italic;'>Rex Kingdon at Walcott Hall</p>

<p>Lively boarding school experiences make this the “best yet”
of the Rex Kingdon series.</p>

<p class='line' style='font-style:italic;'>Rex Kingdon Behind the Bat</p>

<p>The title tells you what this story is; it is a rattling good
story about baseball. Boys will like it.</p>

it. These stories make the best reading you can procure.</p>

<p>The disastrous battle raging in Europe between Germany and
Austria on one side and the Allied countries on the other, has
created demand for literature on the subject. The American
public to a large extent is ignorant of the exact locations of the
fighting zones with its small towns and villages. Major Crockett,
who is familiar with the present battle-fields, has undertaken to
place before the American boy an interesting Series of War stories.</p>

<p>BOY SCOUTS OF THE EAGLE PATROL</p>

<p>In this story, self-reliance and self-defense
through organized athletics are
emphasized.</p>

<p>BOY SCOUTS ON THE RANGE</p>

<p>Cow-punchers, Indians, the Arizona
desert and the Harkness ranch figure in
this tale of the Boy Scouts.</p>

<p>BOY SCOUTS AND THE ARMY AIRSHIP</p>

<p>The cleverness of one of the Scouts as
an amateur inventor and the intrigues of
his enemies to secure his inventions make
a subject of breathless interest.</p>

<p>BOY SCOUTS’ MOUNTAIN CAMP</p>

<p>Just so often as the reader draws a relieved breath at the
escape of the Scouts from imminent danger, he loses it again
in the instinctive impression, which he shares with the boys, of
impending peril.</p>

<p>BOY SCOUTS FOR UNCLE SAM</p>

<p>Patriotism is a vital principle in every Boy Scout organization,
but few there are who have such an opportunity for its practical
expression as comes to the members of the Eagle Patrol.</p>

<p>BOY SCOUTS AT THE PANAMA CANAL</p>

<p>Most timely is this authentic story of the “great ditch.” It is
illustrated by photographs of the Canal in process of Building.</p>

<p>BOY SCOUTS UNDER FIRE IN MEXICO</p>

<p>Another tale appropriate to the unsettled conditions of the present
is this account of recent conflict.</p>

<p>BOY SCOUTS ON BELGIAN BATTLEFIELDS</p>

<p>Wonderfully interesting is the story of Belgium as it figures in
this tale of the Great War.</p>

<p>BOY SCOUTS WITH THE ALLIES IN FRANCE</p>

<p>On the firing line—or very near—we find the Scouts in France.</p>

<p>BOY SCOUTS AT THE PANAMA-PACIFIC EXPOSITION</p>

<p>If you couldn’t attend the Exposition yourself, you can go even
now in imagination with the Boy Scouts.</p>

<p>BOY SCOUTS UNDER SEALED ORDERS</p>

<p>Here the Boy Scouts have a secret mission to perform for the
Government. What is the nature of it? Keen boys will find that
out by reading the book. It’s a dandy story.</p>

<p>BOY SCOUTS’ CAMPAIGN FOR PREPAREDNESS</p>

<p>Just as the Scouts’ motto is “Be Prepared,” just for these reasons
that they prepare for the country’s defense. What they do
and how they do it makes a volume well worth reading.</p>

<p>You do not have to be a Boy Scout to enjoy these fascinating
and well-written stories. Any boy has the chance. Next to the
Manual itself, the books give an accurate description of Boy
Scout activities, for they are educational and instructive.</p>

<p><em>The Motor Cycle Chums Around the World</em></p>

<p>Could Jules Verne have dreamed of encircling the globe with
a motor cycle for emergencies, he would have deemed it an
achievement greater than any he describes in his account of
the amusing travels of Philias Fogg. This, however, is the
purpose successfully carried out by the Motor Cycle Chums,
and the tale of their mishaps, hindrances and delays is one
of intense interest, secret amusement, and incidental
information to the reader.</p>

<p><em>The Motor Cycle Chums of the Northwest Patrol</em></p>

<p>The Great Northwest is a section of vast possibilities and
in it the Motor Cycle Chums meet adventures even more
unusual and exciting than many of their experiences on their
tour around the world. There is not a dull page in this
lively narrative of clever boys and their attendant “Chinee.”</p>

<p><em>The Motor Cycle Chums in the Gold Fields</em></p>

<p>How the Motor Cycle Chums were caught by the lure of the gold
and into what difficulties and novel experiences they were led,
makes a tale of thrilling interest.</p>

<p><em>The Motor Cycle Chums’ Whirlwind Tour</em></p>

<p>To right a wrong is the mission that leads the Riding Rovers
over the border into Mexico and gives the impulse to this story
of amusing adventures and exciting episodes.</p>

<p><em>The Motor Cycle Chums South of the Equator</em></p>

<p>New customs, strange peoples and unfamiliar surroundings add
fresh zest to the interest of the Motor Cycle Chums in travel, and
the tour described in this volume is full of the tropical atmosphere.</p>

<p><em>The Motor Cycle Chums through Historic America</em></p>

<p>The Motor Cycle Chums explore the paths where American history
was made, where interest centers to-day as never before.</p>

<p>You do not need to own either a motor-cycle or a bicycle to
enjoy the thrilling experiences through which the Motor Cycle
Chums pass on their way to seek adventure and excitement.
Brimful of clever episodes.</p>

<p><em>The Boy Inventors’ Wireless Triumph</em></p>

<p>Blest with natural curiosity,—sometimes
called the instinct of investigation,—favored
with golden opportunity, and
gifted with creative ability, the Boy Inventors
meet emergencies and contrive
mechanical wonders that interest and
convince the reader because they always
“work” when put to the test.</p>

<p><em>The Boy Inventors and the Vanishing Gun</em></p>

<p>A thought, a belief, an experiment; discouragement, hope,
effort and final success. This too is the history of the
daring Boy Inventors.</p>

<p><em>The Boy Inventors’ Diving Torpedo Boat</em></p>

<p>As in the previous stories of the Boy Inventors, new and
interesting triumphs of mechanisms are produced which become
immediately valuable, and the stage for their proving and
testing is again the water. On the surface and below it, the
boys have jolly, contagious fun.</p>

<p><em>The Boy Inventors’ Flying Ship</em></p>

<p>A Boston newspaper reporter,—a young fellow with a camera
slung over his shoulders,—wanders into this story at the very
beginning. He finds himself an aerial stowaway and finally a
part of a South American exploring party. How this happens
is an absorbing tale in itself.</p>

<p><em>The Boy Inventors’ Electric Hydroaeroplane</em></p>

<p>The restless, inventive spirit of Jack Chadwick and the persistent
enthusiasm of his cousin, Tom Jesson, once more clamor
for a new expression, and this book describes the unique result
of their labors and the use to which it is opportunely put.</p>

<p><em>The Boy Inventors’ Radio Telephone</em></p>

<p>The determination to adopt, adapt and improve the latest
means of communication gave a fresh impulse to the ambition
of the Boy Inventors.</p>

<p>Watch boys, and you will notice their minds naturally turn to
mechanism. In these delightful stories, the boys try their
genius in new inventions. Read the books and see what they
accomplish through skill and ingenuity.</p>

<p><em>The Dreadnought Boys on Battle Practice</em></p>

<p>Especially interesting and timely is this book which
introduces the reader with its heroes, Ned and Herc, to the
great ships of modern warfare and to the intimate life and
surprising adventures of Uncle Sam’s sailors.</p>

<p><em>The Dreadnought Boys Aboard a Destroyer</em></p>

<p>In this story real dangers threaten and the boys’ patriotism
is tested in a peculiar international tangle. The scene is
laid on the South American coast.</p>

<p><em>The Dreadnought Boys on a Submarine</em></p>

<p>To the inventive genius—trade-school boy or mechanic—this
story has special charm, perhaps, but to every reader its
mystery and clever action are fascinating.</p>

<p><em>The Dreadnought Boys on Aero Service</em></p>

<p>Among the volunteers accepted for Aero Service are Ned and
Herc. Their perilous adventures are not confined to the air,
however, although they make daring and notable flights in
the name of the Government; nor are they always able to fly
beyond the reach of their old “enemies,” who are also airmen.</p>

<p><em>The Dreadnought Boys’ World Cruise</em></p>

<p>From San Francisco the boys start on their world cruise. At
Hawaii, Japan, Egypt and Gibraltar they meet experiences
unforeseen and eventful.</p>

<p><em>The Dreadnought Boys in Home Waters</em></p>

<p>Into mimic naval warfare creeps actual intrigue that complicates
the defense of New York Harbor.</p>

<p>It would be hard work to find a boy—young or old—who is
not keenly alive to the achievements of our great Navy. You
can get a good conception of what Uncle Sam is doing by reading
these marvelous stories.</p>

<p><em>The Ocean Wireless Boys on the Pacific</em></p>

<p>Just as fascinating, thrilling and interesting as any of the
preceding volumes. Plenty of action for red-blooded boys.</p>

<p>The tragedies of the seas became less dreadful with the introduction
of the wireless aboard steamships and it is to be hoped
ultimately that the “ocean grave-yard” will be a thing of the
past. These volumes describe daring and exciting tales.</p>
